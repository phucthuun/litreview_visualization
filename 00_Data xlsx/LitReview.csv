In the current study, the authors used similar associative word lists normed with children and then evaluated the memory of children and adults using these newly normed lists as well as the typical adult-normed lists. Results indicate that children showed lower true and false memories with both the child-normed and adult-normed lists.

Older children (Mage ¼ 69.25 months) outperformed younger children (Mage ¼ 52.35 months) on all measures; however, the only significant predictor of memory for the temporal ordering of events was cognitive shifting.

It has been found to enhance explicit memories in both adults and children. However, in contrast to adults, children do not always show a sleep-related improvement in implicit learning. The majority of research on sleep-dependent memory consolidation focuses on adults; hence, the current study examined sleep-related effects on two tasks in children. Thirty-three typically developing children aged 6–12 years took part in the study. Actigraphy was used to monitor sleep. Sleep-dependent memory consolidation was assessed using a novel non-word learning task and the Tower of Hanoi cognitive puzzle, which involves discovering an underlying rule to aid completion. Children were trained on the two tasks and retested following approximately equal retention intervals of both wake and sleep. After sleep, children showed signiﬁcant improvements in performance of 14% on the non-word learning task and 25% on the Tower of Hanoi task, but no signiﬁcant change in score following the wake retention interval. Improved performance on the Tower of Hanoi may have been due to children consolidating explicit aspects of the task, for example rule-learning or memory of previous sequences; thus, we propose that sleep is necessary for consolidation of explicit memory in children. Sleep quality and duration were not related to children’s task performance. If such experimental sleep-related learning enhancement is generalizable to everyday life, then it is clear that sleep plays a vital role in children’s educational attainment.","2014-06","2022-03-23 11:54:57","2022-03-23 11:54:57","2022-03-23 11:54:57","304-310","","3","23","","J Sleep Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\VSK8EERR\Ashworth et al. - 2014 - Sleep enhances memory consolidation in children.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This was followed by an induction task with perceptual distractors at different levels of featural similarity. An additional 52 children were given the same training followed by an induction task with alternative stimuli. Categorization performance was consistently high; however, we found a gradual transition from a perceptual bias in our youngest children to a category bias around 6 or 7 years of age. In addition, children of all ages were equally distracted by higher levels of featural similarity. The transition is unlikely to be due to an increased ability to inhibit perceptual distractors.

Yet, although infants and young children are recognized to be proﬁcient learners, the ability to act on metacognitive information is not thought to develop until early school years. In the experiments reported here, 3.5-year-olds demonstrated memory-monitoring skills by responding on a non-verbal task originally developed for non-human animals, in which they had to access their knowledge states. Children learned a set of paired associates, and were given the option to skip uncertain trials on a recognition memory test. Accuracy for accepted items was signiﬁcantly higher than for skipped on a subsequent memory task that included all items. Additionally, children whose memorymonitoring assessments more closely matched actual memory performance showed superior overall learning, suggesting a correlation between memory-monitoring and memory itself. The results suggest that children may have implicit access to internal knowledge states at very young ages, providing an explanation for how they are able to guide learning, even as infants.","2008-09","2022-03-23 11:55:06","2022-03-23 11:55:06","2022-03-23 11:55:06","750-760","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\5QFYH8PW\Balcomb and Gerken - 2008 - Three-year-old children can access their own memor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In support of previous research, the author found no age differences in priming in the nonsemantic study/perceptual test condition. Age differences in priming were found in the semantic study/conceptual test condition, however, where college students had significantly higher priming scores than did children. These developmental dissociations support the theory that the processing requirements of conceptual implicit memory are similar to those in explicit memory.

The pattern is remarkable in light of ﬁndings of autobiographical competence among children in the period of life eventually obscured by this amnesia. In the present study, we modiﬁed the cue-word task for use with school-age children. Sevento 10-year-olds successfully generated and dated memories of past events. Girls provided more complete narratives than boys.

The vehicle was a read-aloud activity during which children were presented with a novel fact in each of two passages. In Experiment 1, both age groups showed evidence of integration between the passages. For the 6-year-olds, the evidence came in the form of responses to open-ended questions. The 4-year-olds recognized the correct answers but did not generate them in the open-ended question format. The 6-year-olds who generated the correct answers also were likely to recall both of the individual facts presented in the passages. In Experiment 2, we tested whether the 4-year-olds’ integration performance would improve if their memory for the individual facts improved.

How individual episodes during which children learn new things become integrated with one another to form general knowledge is only beginning to be explored. Integration between separate episodes is called on in educational contexts and in everyday life as a major means of extending knowledge and organizing information. Bauer and San Souci (2010) provided an initial demonstration that 6-year-olds extend their knowledge by integrating between separate but related episodes; the episodes shared a high level of surface similarity. Experiments 1A and 1B of the current research were tests of integration under low and high levels of surface similarity, respectively. In Experiment 1A, when surface similarity of the episodes was low, 6-year-olds integrated between passages of text, yet their performance was not as robust as observed previously. In Experiment 1B, when surface similarity of the episodes was high, a replication of Bauer and San Souci’s results was observed. In Experiment 2, we tested whether a ‘‘hint’’ to consult the information learned in the passages improved performance even when surface level similarity was low. The hint had a strong facilitating effect.

In the current research, we examined 3- and 4-year-old children’s recall of multi-step event sequences immediately after seeing them modeled as a measure of encoding, 1 week later as a measure of the status of the memory trace post-encoding, and 1 month later as an assessment of long-term recall. We tested recall of events with three different levels of internal structure and with three different levels of support for retrieval. Measures of the post-encoding status of the memory trace explained signiﬁcant variance in long-term recall when they were the sole predictors of performance, and they contributed unique variance in long-term recall even after accounting for the variance associated with encoding.

Childhood amnesia is observed in spite of strong evidence that during the period eventually obscured by the amnesia, children construct and preserve autobiographical memories. Why early memories seemingly are lost to recollection is an unanswered question. In the present research, we examined the issue by using the cue word technique to chart the distributions of autobiographical memories in samples of children ages 7 to 11 years and samples of young and middle-aged adults. Among adults, the distributions were best fit by the power function, whereas among children, the exponential function provided a better fit to the distributions of memories. The findings suggest that a major source of childhood amnesia is a constant rate of forgetting in childhood, seemingly resulting from failed consolidation, the outcome of which is a smaller pool of memories available for later retrieval.","2014","2022-03-23 11:55:27","2022-03-23 11:55:27","2022-03-23 11:55:27","597-611","","2","143","","Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","Childhood amnesia in the making","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\JVZYPEGL\Bauer and Larkina - 2014 - Childhood amnesia in the making Different distrib.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Children are assumed to forget autobiographical memories more rapidly than adults, and younger children are assumed to forget more rapidly than older children. Yet few studies can directly inform these comparisons: few feature children and adults, and few prospectively track the survival of speciﬁc autobiographical memories over time. In a 4-year prospective study, we obtained autobiographical memories from children 4, 6, and 8 years, and adults. We tested recall of different subsets of the events after 1, 2, and 3 years. Accelerated rates of forgetting were apparent among all child groups relative to adults; within the child groups, 4- and 6-year-olds had accelerated forgetting relative to 8-year-olds. The differences were especially pronounced in open-ended recall. The thematic coherence of initial memory reports also was a signiﬁcant predictor of the survival of speciﬁc memories.

Adults and children both integrate content acquired in separate episodes, yet they may do so under different task conditions. Neuroimaging studies suggest that adults integrate the contents of separate memory traces at encoding and thus without an explicit prompt; behavioral studies suggest that children do so only when specifically prompted. In the present research, we developed a novel paradigm to test integration of memory content using eye-gaze in an indirect (unprompted) test and self-derivation of new factual knowledge based on related facts in direct (open-ended and forced-choice) tests. To permit use of color images to accompany the stimuli, we developed a procedure for equating color images on 23 low-level properties that otherwise might control eye-gaze behavior. We used the paradigm with adults (Experiment 1) and 7- to 9-year-old children (Experiment 2). Both groups succeeded on the direct tests. Among adults, unprompted integration of memory content (in the indirect test) was apparent and supported open-ended self-derivation (in the direct test). Across trials, children did not show evidence of unprompted integration of memory content and performance during the unprompted indirect test did not support open-ended self-derivation; longer looking to target versus foil images during the indirect test was related to direct test performance under forced-choice conditions, however. The patterns indicate that adults and children engage the process of integration of memory content under different task conditions, and that when integration processes take place without an explicit prompt they have different functional consequences for adults and children.","2021-07","2022-03-23 11:55:52","2022-03-23 11:55:52","2022-03-23 11:55:52","1259-1278","","7","150","","Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","Integration of memory content in adults and children","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\8Z7W54IM\Bauer et al. - 2021 - Integration of memory content in adults and childr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effect of dietary intake on hippocampal-dependent memory during childhood has remained unexamined. Objective: We investigated the cross-sectional relation of dietary components characteristic of the Western diet, including saturated fatty acids (SFAs), omega-3 (n23) fatty acids, and reﬁned sugar, with hippocampal-dependent relational memory in prepubescent children. Design: Participants aged 7–9 y (n = 52) reported their dietary intake by using the Youth-Adolescent Food-Frequency Questionnaire and completed memory tasks designed to assess relational (hippocampal-dependent) and item (hippocampal-independent) memory. Performance on the memory tasks was assessed with both direct (accuracy) and indirect (eye movement) measures. Results: Partial correlations adjusted for body mass index showed a positive relation between relational memory accuracy and intake of omega-3 fatty acids and a negative relation of both relational and item memory accuracy with intake of SFAs. Potential confounding factors of age, sex, intelligence quotient, socioeconomic status, pubertal timing, and aerobic ﬁtness (maximal oxygen volume) were not signiﬁcantly related to any of the dietary intake measures. Eye movement measures of relational memory (preferential viewing to the target stimulus) showed a negative relation with intake of added sugar. Conclusions: SFA intake was negatively associated with both forms of memory, whereas omega-3 fatty acid intake was selectively positively associated with hippocampal-dependent relational memory.

In addition to ignoring information that may turn out to be useful later, selective attention can have long-term costs, such as learned inattention—ignoring formerly irrelevant sources of information in novel situations. In 2 reported experiments, adults and 4-year-old children completed a category learning task in which an unannounced shift occurred such that information that was most relevant became irrelevant, whereas formerly irrelevant information became relevant. Costs stemming from this shift were assessed. The results indicate that adults exhibit greater costs due to learned inattention than young children.

Although differences may arise from various sources, early caregiving has been shown to impact aspects of memory related to relational binding and also the hippocampus, a structure critical to binding. The present study investigated the influences of early and concurrent parenting and maternal lifetime depression history on children’s ability to successfully bind details and retain this information across a delay. A total of 97 children are included in this report. Children were part of a longitudinal study with testing at preschool age (Time 1: 3–5 years) and school age (Time 2: approximately 3 years later). At both time points, positive and negative parenting behaviors were assessed during observational parenting tasks and maternal depression history was assessed with a clinical interview. At Time 2, a composite binding score was derived from two episodic memory tasks: a source memory task and a feature binding task. Findings indicated that early positive parenting predicted higher binding scores later in childhood whereas maternal depression was associated with lower scores. These results were robust even after taking into account child age, general cognitive ability, race, and parental education. These findings highlight 2 factors related to the caregiving environment, parenting and maternal depression, that contribute to individual differences in children’s relational binding ability and underscore the importance of early experience on episodic memory development.","2019-11","2022-03-23 11:56:14","2022-03-23 11:56:14","2022-03-23 11:56:14","2417-2427","","11","55","","Developmental Psychology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\2UHFUAQ5\Botdorf et al. - 2019 - Early positive parenting and maternal depression h.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite its importance for the ontogeny of memory, data regarding the maturation of PS during childhood is still scarce. PS is known to rely on the hippocampus, particularly on hippocampal subfields DG and CA3. In this study, we used a memory discrimination task, a behavioral proxy for PS, and manually segmented hippocampal subfields volumes in the hippocampal body in a cohort of 26 children aged from 5 to 12 years. We examined the association between subfields volumes and memory discrimination performance. The main results were: (1) we showed age-related differences of memory discrimination suggesting a continuous increase of memory performance during early to late childhood. (2) We evidenced distinct associations between age and the volumes of hippocampal subfield, suggesting distinct developmental trajectories. (3) We showed a relationship between memory discrimination performance and the volumes of CA3 and subiculum. Our results further confirm the role of CA3 in memory discrimination, and suggest to scrutinize more closely the role of the subiculum.

The complementarity prediction is this: If subjects separately judge whether those same events are new but similar to old ones, adults will be more accurate than children, even though adults are less accurate when they judge whether the items are old. We report 4 experiments in which children (6- and 10-year-olds), adolescents (14-year-olds), and adults encoded the modal developmental reversal materials: DeeseϪRoedigerϪMcDermott lists. Then, they responded to memory tests on which half the subjects judged whether test items were old and half judged whether the same items were newϪsimilar.

Research with adults indicates that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in memory retrieval of schema-related information. However, developmental differences between children and adults in the neural correlates of schema-related memories are not well understood. One reason for this is the inherent confound between schema-relevant experience and maturation, as both are related to time. To overcome this limitation, we used a novel paradigm that experimentally induces, and then probes for, task-relevant knowledge during encoding of new information. Thirty-one children aged 8–12 years and 26 young adults participated in the experiment. While successfully retrieving schema-congruent events, children showed less medial PFC activity than adults. In addition, medial PFC activity during successful retrieval correlated positively with children’s age. While successfully retrieving schema-incongruent events, children showed stronger hippocampus (HC) activation as well as weaker connectivity between the striatum and the dorsolateral PFC than adults. These findings were corroborated by an exploratory full-factorial analysis investigating age differences in the retrieval of schema-congruent versus schema-incongruent events, comparing the two conditions directly. Consistent with the findings of the separate analyses, two clusters, one in the medial PFC, one in the HC, were identified that exhibited a memory 9 congruency 9 age group interaction. In line with the two-component model of episodic memory development, the present findings point to an age-related shift from a more HC-bound processing to an increasing recruitment of prefrontal brain regions in the retrieval of schema-related events.","2017-11","2022-03-23 11:56:45","2022-03-23 11:56:45","2022-03-23 11:56:45","e12475","","6","20","","Dev Sci","Neural activation patterns during retrieval of schema-related memories","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\9N4YMAXJ\Brod et al. - 2017 - Neural activation patterns during retrieval of sch.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared the three age groups on their memory congruency effect (i.e., better memory for knowledgecongruent associations) and on a schema bias score, which measures the participants’ tendency to commit knowledge-congruent memory errors. We found that prior knowledge similarly benefited memory for items encoded in a congruent context in all age groups. However, for associative memory, older adults and, to a lesser extent, children overrelied on their prior knowledge, as indicated by both an enhanced congruency effect and schema bias. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) performed during memory encoding revealed an age-independent memory x congruency interaction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Furthermore, the magnitude of vmPFC recruitment correlated positively with the schema bias. These findings suggest that older adults are most prone to rely on their prior knowledge for episodic memory decisions, but that children can also rely heavily on prior knowledge that they are well acquainted with. Furthermore, the fMRI results suggest that the vmPFC plays a key role in the assimilation of new information into existing knowledge structures across the entire lifespan. vmPFC recruitment leads to better memory for knowledge-congruent information but also to a heightened susceptibility to commit knowledge-congruent memory errors, in particular in children and older adults.","2019-06","2022-03-23 11:56:47","2022-03-23 11:56:47","2022-03-23 11:56:47","1326-1337","","6","55","","Developmental Psychology","A boon and a bane","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\TFWUFQZJ\Brod and Shing - 2019 - A boon and a bane Comparing the effects of prior .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, while it is assumed that the reinforcing properties of said avoidance leads to the emergence of an overgeneral recall style over time, this question has not been addressed developmentally. To explore these issues, two studies were conducted. In Study 1, 41 children and adolescents (Mage = 12 years) were randomly assigned to recall overgeneral or specific negative memories on the Autobiographical Memory Test; participants later listened to their memories and provided pre- and post-tests of their emotional states at four time points: before and after memory generation and before and after memory exposure. In Study 2, 52 college-aged participants (Mage = 19 years) completed the same protocol. Results indicated that children and adolescents in the overgeneral condition reported higher levels of positive affect relative to those in the specific condition, while recall condition did not impact adults’ emotional states.

However, studies examining relations between hippocampal volume and memory across development yield mixed results. This may be due in part to the fact that volume is a coarser measure of hippocampal composition. Studies have begun to examine measures of diffusion, which capture characteristics of the microstructure of the hippocampus, and thus may provide additional information about the integrity of the underlying neural circuits. The present study applied this approach to a developmental period characterized by dramatic changes in both hippocampal microstructure and memory behavior – early childhood. Specifically, measures of hippocampal microstructural integrity were related to age and source memory performance in 93 children aged 4–8 years. Results revealed significant negative associations between hippocampal mean diffusivity and both age and memory, even after controlling for differences in hippocampal volume. These results suggest that hippocampal diffusion may provide additional, independent information about hippocampal integrity compared to volume, particularly during early childhood when important developmental changes have been proposed.","2020-09-16","2022-03-23 11:57:22","2022-03-23 11:57:22","2022-03-23 11:57:22","568953","","","11","","Front.

Research on memory in young children suggests their memories often lack high-resolution details, i.e., show impoverished pattern separation (PS). Recently developed assessments of PS suitable for children allow us to relate the formation of distinct, detailed memories for the development of the hippocampus, a neural structure critical for this ability in adults. The hippocampus displays a protracted developmental proﬁle and underlies the ability to form detailed memories. This study examined age-related differences in hippocampal subﬁeld volumes in 4- to 8-year-old children and relations with performance on a mnemonic similarity task (MST) designed to index memory speciﬁcity. Results revealed age-moderated associations between MST performance and cornu ammonis 2-4/dentate gyrus subﬁelds. Speciﬁcally, age-related differences in the ability to form detailed memories tracked with normative patterns of volume increases followed by reductions over this age range. That is, greater volume correlated with better performance in younger children, whereas smaller volume correlated with better performance in older children. These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that developmental differences in hippocampal circuitry contribute to age-related improvements in detailed memory formation during this period.","2019-07-22","2022-03-23 11:57:25","2022-03-23 11:57:25","2022-03-23 11:57:25","3427-3433","","8","29","","","It’s All in the Details","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\QU4NA6AQ\Canada et al. - 2019 - It’s All in the Details Relations Between Young C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a source memory paradigm, ERP components related to episodic memory, the negative component (Nc), and late slow wave (LSW) were examined in 4- to 8-year-old children. Analyses focused on trials for which children correctly remembered the source related to an item versus trials where the item was remembered but the source was forgotten.

Specifically, LSW effects were similar across source correct and source incorrect trials in all high-performing children and in low-performing older children; however, LSW effects differed across conditions in low-performing younger children.

The present study utilized an accelerated longitudinal design in order to characterize the developmental trajectory of temporal order memory in a sample of 200 healthy 4- to 8-year-old children. Specifically, two tasks commonly used in the literature were tested longitudinally: a primacy judgment task and an ordering task. Results revealed that, even after controlling for differences in IQ, linearly increasing trajectories characterized age-related change in performance for both tasks; however, change appeared greater for the temporal ordering task.

The results showed that older children were more able than younger children to reject associative false memories through warnings and by slowing the presentation rate.

An alternative theory is described, in which changes in early memory and metamemory are mediated by representational changes, independent of PFC maturation. In a pilot study and Experiment 1, younger children failed to recognize previously presented pictures, yet the children could identify the context in which they occurred, suggesting these failures resulted from inefficient metamemory. Older children seldom exhibited such failure. Experiment 2 established that this was not due to retrieval-time recoding. Experiment 3 suggested that young children’s representation of a picture’s attributes explained their metamemory failure. Experiment 4 demonstrated that metamemory is age-invariant when representational quality is controlled: When stimuli were equivalently represented, age differences in memory and metamemory declined. These findings do not support the traditional view that as children develop, neural maturation permits more efficient monitoring, which leads to improved memory. These findings support a theory based on developmental–representational synthesis, in which constraints on metamemory are independent of neurological development; representational features drive early memory to a greater extent than previously acknowledged, suggesting that neural maturation has been overimputed as a source of early metamemory and memory failure.","2010","2022-03-23 11:57:57","2022-03-23 11:57:57","2022-03-23 11:57:57","464-495","","2","117","","Psychological Review","Representational constraints on the development of memory and metamemory","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\WDE7FL9Y\Ceci et al. - 2010 - Representational constraints on the development of.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Children's exposure to stressors in the past year, cognitive abilities, and brain structure were assessed at follow-up. Early cumulative risk was prospectively associated with reduced total gray matter volume, cortex volume, right superior parietal and inferior parietal thickness, and poorer attention shifting and memory.

Children were then administered verbal and performance intelligence tests and a self-perception measure assessing perceived general competence and social acceptance. Additionally, teachers completed a questionnaire to evaluate children’s shyness and emotionality. Results revealed that children with higher verbal intelligence recalled more information spontaneously than those with lower verbal intelligence and that children who provided more accurate cued recall were less suggestible than those who gave less accurate cued recall. There was also a signiﬁcant interaction effect of verbal intelligence Â age on suggestibility, with verbal intelligence being associated with suggestibility for younger children, but not for older children.

The development in children and adolescents of successful memory encoding for scenes has been associated with increased activation in PFC, but not MTL, regions. However, evidence suggests that a functional subregion of the MTL that supports scene perception, located in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), goes through a prolonged maturation process. Here we tested the hypothesis that maturation of scene perception supports the development of memory for complex scenes. Scenes were characterized by their levels of complexity deﬁned by the number of unique object categories depicted in the scene. Recognition memory improved with age, in participants ages 8–24, for high-, but not low-, complexity scenes. High-complexity compared to low-complexity scenes activated a network of regions including the posterior PHG. The difference in activations for high- versus low-complexity scenes increased with age in the right posterior PHG. Finally, activations in right posterior PHG were associated with age-related increases in successful memory formation for high-, but not low-, complexity scenes.These results suggest that functional maturation of the right posterior PHG plays a critical role in the development of enduring long-term recollection for high-complexity scenes.","2010","2022-03-23 11:58:04","2022-03-23 11:58:04","2022-03-23 11:58:04","","","","4","","Front.

In children, deactivation of the default-network did not differ reliably between scenes that were later remembered or forgotten.

Current behavioral tests that have been developed to assess episodic memory differ substantially in their surface features. Therefore, it is possible that these tests are assessing different memory processes. In this study, 106 children aged 3 to 6 years were tested on four putative tests of episodic memory. Covariation in performance was investigated in order to address two conﬂicting hypotheses: (a) that the high level of difference between the tests will result in little covariation in performance despite their being designed to assess the same ability and (b) that the conceptual similarity of these tasks will lead to high levels of covariation despite surface differences. The results indicated a gradual improvement with age on all tests. Performances on many of the tests were related, but not after controlling for age. A principal component analysis found that a single principal component was able to satisfactorily ﬁt the observed data. This principal component produced a marginally stronger correlation with age than any test alone. As such, it might be concluded that different tests of episodic memory are too different to be used in parallel. Nevertheless, if used together, these tests may offer a robust assessment of episodic memory as a complex multifaceted process.","2015-09","2022-03-23 11:58:12","2022-03-23 11:58:12","2022-03-23 11:58:12","164-171","","","137","","Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","The six blind men and the elephant","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\CT4BDIS4\Cheke and Clayton - 2015 - The six blind men and the elephant Are episodic m.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last 10 years, there has been some erosion of this view by demonstrations that all adult-like behavioural properties are qualitatively present in young children and infants. Determining the age of maturity, however, requires quantitative comparison across age groups, a task made difﬁcult by the need to disentangle development in face perception from development in all the other cognitive factors that affect task performance. Here, we argue that full quantitative maturity is reached early, by 5–7 years at the latest and possibly earlier. This is based on a comprehensive literature review of results in the 5-years-to-adult age range, with particular focus on the results of the few previous studies that are methodologically suitable for quantitative comparison of face effects across age, plus three new experiments testing development of holistic/conﬁgural processing (faces versus objects, disproportionate inversion effect), ability to encode novel faces (assessed via implicit memory) and face-space (own-age bias).","2009-05","2022-03-23 11:58:30","2022-03-23 11:58:30","2022-03-23 11:58:30","219-247","","2","111","","Cognition","Early maturity of face recognition","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\3YKUGXJZ\Crookes and McKone - 2009 - Early maturity of face recognition No childhood d.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the recognition task, participants were asked to make binary old/new recognition judgments, while in the source task, they were asked to make trinary old-green/old-red/new source judgements.

It has been suggested that the frontal lobes play a critical role in the retrieval of source information, and that this brain region relative to the medial temporal lobes continues to develop into late adolescence.

Volumes of hippocampal subﬁelds (subiculum, CA1-2, CA3-dentate gyrus) and anterior-posterior divisions (hippocampal head, body, tail) were manually segmented from high-resolution images in a sample of healthy participants (age 8–25 years). Adults had smaller CA3-dentate gyrus volume as compared to children, which accounted for 67% of the indirect eﬀect of age predicting better associative memory via hippocampal volumes. Whereas hippocampal body volume demonstrated non-linear age diﬀerences, larger hippocampal body volume was weakly related to better associative memory only when accounting for the mutual correlation with subﬁelds measured within that region.

Traditionally, developmental improvements in episodic retrieval have been thought to depend on strategic processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region that is considered to have a protracted course of development relative to the hippocampus. The primary goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the development of episodic retrieval is also associated with changes in hippocampal function.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired while participants attempted to recall which colour was originally paired with each drawing. Correct recall of item-colour pairings indicated successful episodic retrieval. Activity in the anterior hippocampus, but not in the posterior hippocampus, was associated with episodic retrieval in adults, whereas activity in the posterior, but not in the anterior hippocampus, was associated with episodic retrieval in children.

Previous research has inconsistently reported associations between hippocampal volume and episodic memory performance during this period. We argue that this inconsistency may be due to assessing the hippocampus as a whole, and propose to examine associations separately for subregions along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. In the present study, we examined age-related differences in volumes of the hippocampal head, body, and tail, and collected episodic memory measures in children ages 8–11 years and young adults (N = 62). We found that adults had a smaller right hippocampal head, larger hippocampal body bilaterally, and smaller right hippocampal tail compared with children.

This task, unlike previous source monitoring tasks used with children, has the potential to show the existence of a serious kind of source error called source amnesia. Children of 4, 6 and 8 years participated. They also completed measures believed to assess prefrontal function. Children showed a steady improvement with age in their ability to remember facts, but showed abrupt improvement between 4 and 6 years in their ability to monitor the source of those facts. Most notably, 4-year-old children displayed a great deal of source amnesia (i.e. errors of the kind committed by populations with frontal dysfunction), but 6- and 8-year-old children showed very few such errors. In addition, source memory was related, in some analyses although not in others, to behavioral measures often used to assess prefrontal functioning.

However, little is known about the developmental origin of this cognitive process. In the present study, 5- and 7-year-old children viewed stimuli that varied in size and reproduced each from memory. Consistent with the predictions of a Bayesian model of category effects on estimation, responses were adjusted toward the central value of the stimulus distribution.

In this study, the role of working memory and inhibitory control in recognition memory and source monitoring with two different retrieval strategies were examined. Children (N = 263) aged 4–8 participated in science activities with two sources. They were later given a recognition and source-monitoring test, and completed measures of working memory and inhibitory control. During the source-monitoring test, half of the participants were asked about sources serially (one after the other) whereas the other half of the children were asked about sources in parallel (considering both sources simultaneously). Results demonstrated that working memory was a predictor of source-monitoring accuracy in both conditions, but inhibitory control was only related to source accuracy in the parallel condition. When age was controlled these relationships were no longer signiﬁcant, suggesting that a more general cognitive development factor is a stronger predictor of source monitoring than executive function alone. Interestingly, the children aged 4–6 years made more accurate source decisions in the parallel condition than in the serial condition. The older children (aged 7–8) were overall more accurate than the younger children, and their accuracy did not differ as a function of interview condition. Suggestions are provided to guide further research in this area that will clarify the diverse results of previous studies examining whether executive function is a cognitive prerequisite for effective source monitoring.","2014-05-08","2022-03-23 11:59:40","2022-03-23 11:59:40","2022-03-23 11:59:40","","","","5","","Front.

To accumulate knowledge over time and experiences, learners must engage in productive processes, going beyond what is explicitly given to generate new knowledge. Though important to accumulating knowledge, these processes are also easily disrupted. Individuals often depend on surface level similarities, such as visual features, to recognize the relation between learning episodes. When the surface level similarity is low, performance on tasks that depend on productive processes, such as selfderivation through integration of new knowledge, suffers. The major purpose of the present research was to examine whether presentation of related information in different languages poses a challenge to memory integration and self-derivation, due to low levels of surface similarity between episodes of learning through different languages. In Study 1, 62 children (Grade 2; mean age= 8;1 years) listened to story-passages containing novel facts that could be integrated to selfderive new knowledge. Related passages were presented either through the same language or through two different languages (cross-language condition; Spanish and English). There were no significant differences between presentation conditions. In Study 2, 100 children (Grades 3 and 4; mean age=9.7 years) heard novel facts in single sentences, again presented in either a samelanguage or cross-language condition. Whereas 3rd-grade cross-language performance suffered compared to same-language English controls, 4th-grade performance did not. Results suggest that in addition to language proficiency, rich contextual support and experience in a bilingual environment facilitate cross-language integration.","2019-11","2022-03-23 11:59:52","2022-03-23 11:59:52","2022-03-23 11:59:52","104661","","","187","","Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","Self-derivation through memory integration under low surface similarity conditions","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\TJZDNRQX\Esposito and Bauer - 2019 - Self-derivation through memory integration under l.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We administered a repeated continuous recognition task to children (N ϭ 20, 10 –12 years), younger adults (N ϭ 20, 20 –27 years), and older adults (N ϭ 21, 68 –76 years). Participants saw the same set of unrelated word pairs in 3 consecutive runs and their task was to identify pair reoccurrences within runs. Across runs, correct detection of repeated pairs decreased in children only, whereas false recognition of lure pairs showed a greater increase in older adults than in children or younger adults. False recognition of rearranged pairs decreased across runs for all participants. This decrease was most pronounced in children, in particular for high-confidence memory errors. We conclude that memory binding mechanisms are sufficiently developed in children to facilitate memory monitoring and reduce false memory for associative information. In contrast, older adults show senescent impairments in both binding and monitoring mechanisms that both contribute to elevated illusory recollections in old age.

However, the neural changes underlying this development and its relevance for general intellectual development are largely unknown. We assessed 7- to 15-year-old children on multiple occasions and showed continued longitudinal improvements in introspection on memory accuracy into adolescence. We demonstrated that introspection ability contributes to longitudinal changes in children’s general intelligence and identified specific patterns of developmental changes in brain anatomy that predicted improvements in metamemory monitoring. This research highlights the mechanisms supporting metamemory development and their critical role for learning.           ,                             Metamemory monitoring, or the ability to introspect on the accuracy of one’s memories, improves considerably during childhood, but the underlying neural changes and implications for intellectual development are largely unknown. The present study examined whether cortical changes in key brain areas hypothesized to support metacognition contribute to the development of metamemory monitoring from late childhood into early adolescence. Metamemory monitoring was assessed among 7- to 12-y-old children (               n               = 145) and adults (               n               = 31).

Results showed that metamemory monitoring continues to improve from childhood into adolescence. More pronounced cortical thinning in the anterior insula and a greater increase in the thickness of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex over the three assessment points predicted these improvements. Thus, performance benefits are linked to the unique patterns of regional cortical change during development. Metamemory monitoring at the first time point predicted intelligence at the third time point and vice versa, suggesting parallel development of these abilities and their reciprocal influence. Together, these results provide insights into the neuroanatomical correlates supporting the development of the capacity to self-reflect, and highlight the role of this capacity for general intellectual development.","2017-07-18","2022-03-23 11:59:57","2022-03-23 11:59:57","2022-03-23 11:59:57","7582-7587","","29","114","","Proc.

The present study used multivariate pattern analysis to examine the distinctiveness of different scene representations in 169 children and 31 adults, and its relation to memory performance. Most children provided data over up to three measurement occasions between 8 and 15 years (267 total scans), allowing us to examine changes in memory and neural specificity over time. Memory performance was lower in children than in adults, and increased in children over time. Different scenes presented during memory encoding could be reliably decoded from parahippocampal, lateral occipital, and retrosplenial regions in children and adults. Neural specificity in children was similar to adults, and did not change reliably over time. Among children, higher neural specificity in sceneprocessing regions was associated with better memory concurrently.

We therefore explored the relationship between statistical learning and the thickness and volume of structures that are traditionally implicated in declarative and procedural memory, focusing specifically on the left inferior PFC, the hippocampus, and the caudate during early childhood (ages 5–8.5 years). We found that the thickness of the left inferior frontal cortex and volume of the right hippocampus predicted statistical learning ability in young children. Importantly, these regions did not change in thickness or volume with age, but the relationship between learning and the right hippocampus interacted with age such that older children's hippocampal structure more strongly predicted performance. Overall, the data show that children's statistical learning is supported by multiple neural structures that are more broadly implicated in learning and memory, especially declarative memory (hippocampus) and attention/top–down control (the PFC).","2019-01","2022-03-23 12:00:11","2022-03-23 12:00:11","2022-03-23 12:00:11","126-137","","1","31","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\ZBFXPP7U\Finn et al. - 2019 - Prefrontal and Hippocampal Structure Predict Stati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although this view was confirmed in numerous studies in adults, it is not known whether it can be generalized to sleep during development. Here, we examined effects of sleep on implicit memory formation considered of particular relevance in children, because brain structures underlying implicit learning develop earlier in ontogeny than structures supporting explicit learning. Subjects were 7- to 11-year-old children (n = 14) and 20- to 30-year-old adults (n = 12) tested on a serial reaction time task before (learning) and after (retest) equal length retention periods of overnight sleep and daytime wakefulness. At learning, after eight training blocks, all subjects had acquired implicit knowledge of the probabilistic rules underlying the sequential stimulus materials, as indicated by a substantial difference in response time to grammatical versus nongrammatical trials in two test blocks that followed the training blocks. At learning, this response time difference was greater in children (48.49 ± 6.08 msec) than adults (28.02 ± 3.65 msec, p &lt; .01), but did not differ between sleep and wake retention conditions in either age group. Consistent with previous studies, retesting in the adults revealed that the reaction time differences between grammatical and nongrammatical trials increased by 9.78 ± 4.82 msec after sleep, but decreased by −12.76 ± 5.49 msec after the wake retention period (p &lt; .01). Contrary to this finding in adults, sleep in children did not lead to an increase, but to a decrease in the reaction time difference averaging −26.68 ± 12.25 msec (p &lt; .05), whereas across the wake retention interval the reaction time difference remained nearly unchanged. The sleep-dependent deterioration in measures of implicit sequence knowledge in children was in striking contrast to the gain of such knowledge in the adults during sleep (p &lt; .01). Our findings indicate that the functional role of sleep in implicit memory consolidation depends on age. We speculate that the overnight decrease of implicit knowledge in children reflects a preferential effect of sleep toward the enhancement of explicit aspects of task performance that interferes with implicit performance gains.","2007-02-01","2022-03-23 12:00:13","2022-03-23 12:00:13","2022-03-23 12:00:13","214-227","","2","19","","","Developmental Differences in Sleep's Role for Implicit Off-line Learning","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\L2RQ7R8U\Fischer et al. - 2007 - Developmental Differences in Sleep's Role for Impl.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the current study was to examine age- and performancerelated effects on encoding in children between 4 and 8 years of age using event-related potentials (ERPs). Results revealed effects of both age and performance on encoding, as indexed by the ERPs response. However, the nature of these effects differed between subsequent recognition and subsequent recollection, as well as for the two ERP components (i.e., Nc and LSW) examined.

Study design Thirty-three children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and a history of DKA and 29 children with T1DM without a history of DKA were enrolled from an academic hospital pediatric endocrinology clinic. These groups were comparable on demographic and disease-related variables. These groups’ ability to recall events in association with speciﬁc details, the memory function most directly affected by mild hypoxia/ischemia, was compared on 2 tasks (ie, event-color associations and event–spatial position associations). Results In multivariate analyses controlling for other critical variables, children with DKA history had signiﬁcantly lower rates of accurate memory on both tasks (mean, 0.34 Æ 0.13 on the color task and 0.57 Æ 0.15 on the spatial task) than did children without DKA history (mean, 0.44 Æ 0.11 and 0.65 Æ 0.18, P < .01).

Drawing from a longitudinal investigation of the development of memory, repeated assessments of children’s (N = 107) strategy use and declarative metamemory were made to examine the development of these skills and the relations between them over time. Latent curve models were used ﬁrst to estimate the trajectories of children’s strategy use and metamemory and then to examine predictors of children’s performance in each of these domains. Children’s metamemory at the beginning of Grade 1 was linked to child- and home-level factors, whereas the development of both skills was related to maternal education level. Additional modeling of the longitudinal relations between strategic sorting and metacognitive knowledge indicated that metamemory at earlier time points was predictive of subsequent strategy use.","2011-01","2022-03-23 12:01:24","2022-03-23 12:01:24","2022-03-23 12:01:24","139-155","","1","108","","Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","Relations between children’s metamemory and strategic performance","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\QV5BM88S\Grammer et al. - 2011 - Relations between children’s metamemory and strate.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These processes are psychologically and computationally distinct, and may have implications for the acquisition of categories at different hierarchical levels. The present study examines an account of children’s difﬁculty in acquiring categories at the subordinate level grounded on these distinct comparison processes. Adults and children performed category learning tasks in which they were exposed either to pairs of objects from the same novel category or pairs of objects from different categories. The objects were designed so that for each category learning task, two features determined category membership whereas two other features were task irrelevant. In the learning stage participants compared pairs of objects noted to be either from the same category or from different categories. Object pairs were chosen so that the objective amount of information provided to the participants was identical in the two learning conditions. We found that when presented only with object pairs noted to be from the same category, young children (6 6 YO 6 9.5) learned the novel categories just as well as older children (10 6 YO 6 14) and adults. However, when presented only with object pairs known to be from different categories, unlike older children and adults, young children failed to learn the novel categories. We discuss cognitive and computational factors that may give rise to this comparison bias, as well as its expected outcomes.","2009-07","2022-03-23 12:01:47","2022-03-23 12:01:47","2022-03-23 12:01:47","105-119","","1","112","","Cognition","The development of category learning strategies","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\JMDFYVYI\Hammer et al. - 2009 - The development of category learning strategies W.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One approach seeks to describe hippocampal function by probing the memory representations that the hippocampus supports. Another approach focuses on the role of the hippocampus in pattern separation and completion. Each of these approaches to understanding hippocampal function utilizes a distinct set of specialized tasks, and both of these task sets are known to be sensitive to changes in hippocampal function with age and disease status. But the question remains whether the tasks utilized in these two approaches tap into the same aspects of hippocampal function. We explored this question in the context of hippocampal development. Preadolescent children (N = 73) and young adults (N = 41) completed an identical battery of cognitive tasks consisting of a spatial reconstruction relational memory task, the mnemonic similarity task (MST)—an object-based pattern separation task, and a novel hybrid task—the Object Discrimination and Distribution (ODD) Task—designed to integrate and simultaneously tax pattern separation and spatial relational memory.

In both studies, 5– to 6-year-old children and adults were shown instances of a basic-level category (dogs) followed by a test set containing old and new category members that varied in their similarity to study items. Participants were given either recognition instructions (memorize study items and discriminate between old and new test items) or induction instructions (learn about a novel property shared by the study items and decide whether it generalizes to test items). Across both tasks, children made a greater number of positive responses than did adults. Across both age groups, a greater number of positive responses were made in induction than in recognition. The application of a mathematical model, called GEN-EX for generalization from examples, showed that both memory and reasoning data could be explained by a single exemplar-based process that assumes task and age differences in generalization gradients.

We replicated the main trends reported by Ghetti and Angelini (2008) in that recognition hit rates increased from 6 to 9 years of age, with larger age changes following deep than shallow encoding. Formal versions of the dual-process high threshold signal detection model and several single-process models (equal variance signal detection, unequal variance signal detection, mixture signal detection) were fit to the developmental data. The unequal variance and mixture signal detection models gave a better account of the data than either of the other models. A state-trace analysis found evidence for only one underlying memory process across the age range tested.

In the present experiment, we examined episodic memory in 3- and 4-year-old children. To do this, we developed a hide-and-seek task that allowed us to assess children’s recall of the what-where-when (www) of the hiding event. In this task, the experimenter and the child hid three plush toys in three separate locations around the house. After a brief retention interval, children were asked to verbally recall, in order (i.e., when), what toy was hiding where. Following this verbal test, children were given the opportunity to ﬁnd the toys. On the verbal recall test, 4year-olds reported more information than 3-year-olds. On the behavioral recall test, 3-year-olds performed equivalently to 4-year-olds on the where components of the test, however, their performance on the when component remained inferior to that of 4-year-olds. We conclude that, by the age of 3, children exhibit rudimentary episodic memory skills, and that strict reliance on verbal recall may underestimate their episodic memory ability. ß 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

They then completed a forced-choice test, provided confidence judgments for each response, and decided whether to select or exclude answers to be evaluated for the possibility of reward. Fourand 5-year-olds, but not 3-year-olds, reported lower certainty for incorrect and weaker memories than for correct and stronger memories, and they judiciously excluded their least confident memories, which resulted in accuracy gains for selected memories; these findings highlight age-related improvements in introspection on memory accuracy.

Since context familiarity can be easily manipulated in children, we chose 5-year-olds as study participants. In two experiments, we demonstrated robust memory-updating effects in children. Spatial context triggered incorporation of new information into old memories only when the context was unfamiliar. In highly familiar spatial environments (children’s homes), spatial context did not initiate memory updating.

For example, a simple question, such as “Do you remember your wedding day?” can reactivate rich memories of the past, allowing us to recall experiences that may have occurred days, weeks, and even decades earlier. The ability to use another person’s language to access our memory of a prior experience is considered to be one of the hallmarks in human memory development, but surprisingly, little is known about the ontogeny of this fundamental ability. Prior research has shown that by 4 years of age, children can use a simple verbal reminder (e.g., “Do you remember coming here before?”) to reactivate an otherwise inaccessible memory of a unique visual stimulus. Given that language comprehension precedes production, it has been hypothesized that the ability to use verbal reminders may emerge well before 4 years of age. In the present experiment, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether a verbal reminder reactivated memory in 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old children who were tested using the visual-paired comparison (VPC) paradigm. Our findings showed that the ability to exploit a simple verbal reminder emerges by at least 2 years of age.","2013-06","2022-03-23 12:02:50","2022-03-23 12:02:50","2022-03-23 12:02:50","1058-1065","","6","49","","Developmental Psychology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\XIYJQRGG\Imuta et al. - 2013 - The effect of verbal reminders on memory reactivat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This holistic retrieval can occur, under specific conditions, when each within-event association is encoded in a separate temporal context: adults are able to integrate the information into a single coherent representation. In this study, we sought to replicate the holistic retrieval of simultaneously encoded event elements in children, and examine whether children can similarly integrate across separated encoding contexts. Children (aged 6–7 years; 9–10 years) and adults encoded two series of three-element “events” consisting of an animal, object, and location. In the simultaneous condition, they encountered all three event elements at once; in the separated condition, they encountered each pairwise association separately (animal-object, animal-location, object-location). After encoding, they were tested on the retrieval of each within-event association using a 4-alternative-forced-choice task. We inferred the presence of holistic retrieval using a measure of retrieval dependency—the statistical dependency between retrieval of within-event associations. Memory for the pairs improved across ages, but there were no developmental differences in retrieval dependency. In the simultaneous encoding condition, all three age groups showed retrieval dependency. However, counter to previous studies, retrieval dependency was not observed in any age group following separated encoding. The results from the simultaneous encoding condition support the idea that pattern completion processes are developed by early childhood. The absence of retrieval dependency in adults following separated encoding prevent conclusions regarding the developmental trajectory of mnemonic integration.","2021-02-12","2022-03-23 12:02:54","2022-03-23 12:02:54","2022-03-23 12:02:54","13","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\PDBCXMCB\James et al. - 2021 - The Formation and Retrieval of Holistic Event Memo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given tremendous developmental changes in SP and SO morphology, it remains elusive whether across childhood the same mechanisms as identified in adults are functional. Based on topography and frequency, we characterize slow and fast SPs and their temporal coupling to SOs in 24 pre-­school children. Further, we ask whether slow and fast SPs and their modulation during SOs are associated with behavioral indicators of declarative memory consolidation as suggested by the literature on adults. Employing an individually tailored approach, we reliably identify an inherent, development-­specific fast centro-p­ arietal SP type, nested in the adult-­like slow SP frequency range, along with a dominant slow frontal SP type. Further, we provide evidence that the modulation of fast centro-p­ arietal SPs during SOs is already present in pre-­ school children. However, the temporal coordination between fast centro-­parietal SPs and SOs is weaker and less precise than expected from research on adults. While we do not find evidence for a critical contribution of SP–S­ O coupling for memory consolidation, crucially, slow frontal and fast centro-­parietal SPs are each differentially related to sleep-­associated consolidation of items of varying quality. Whereas a higher number of slow frontal SPs is associated with stronger maintenance of medium-­quality memories, a higher number of fast centro-­parietal SPs is linked to a greater gain of low-­quality items.

Studies on category learning and memory have suggested that children may be more focused on items than adults. If this is also the case for statistical learning, children may not extract and learn the multi-level regularities that adults can. We report three experiments showing that children and adults extract both item- and category-level regularities in statistical learning. In Experiments 1 and 2, we show that both children and adults can learn structure at the item and category levels when they are measured independently. In Experiment 3, we show that both children and adults learn about categories even when exposure does not require this: both are able to generalize their learning from the item to the category level. Results indicate that statistical learning operates across multi-level structure in children and adults alike, enabling generalization of learning from specific items to exemplars from categories of those items that observers have never seen.

Our findings allow us to speculate that the heterogeneous development of subregions within the hippocampus—a brain region crucial for laying down novel memories—contributes to this developmental lag in memory. Specifically, we used in vivo high-resolution structural MRI and memory tests in a large sample of children aged 6–14 years and young adults to characterize hippocampal development. We show that hippocampal maturity as expressed in the multivariate pattern of age-related differences in hippocampal subregions is specifically related to the ability to lay down highly specific memories.           ,              Adaptive learning systems need to meet two complementary and partially conflicting goals: detecting regularities in the world versus remembering specific events. The hippocampus (HC) keeps a fine balance between computations that extract commonalities of incoming information (i.e., pattern completion) and computations that enable encoding of highly similar events into unique representations (i.e., pattern separation). Histological evidence from young rhesus monkeys suggests that HC development is characterized by the differential development of intrahippocampal subfields and associated networks. However, due to challenges in the in vivo investigation of such developmental organization, the ontogenetic timing of HC subfield maturation remains controversial. Delineating its course is important, as it directly influences the fine balance between pattern separation and pattern completion operations and, thus, developmental changes in learning and memory. Here, we relate in vivo, high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging data of HC subfields to behavioral memory performance in children aged 6–14 y and in young adults. We identify a multivariate profile of age-related differences in intrahippocampal structures and show that HC maturity as captured by this pattern is associated with age differences in the differential encoding of unique memory representations.","2017-08-22","2022-03-23 12:03:19","2022-03-23 12:03:19","2022-03-23 12:03:19","9212-9217","","34","114","","Proc.

Stress exposures during childhood have been linked to altered hippocampal structure and memory performance in adulthood. Animal studies suggest that these differences are in part driven by aberrant glucocorticoid secretion during development, with strongest effects on the CA3 region and the dentate gyrus (CA3-DG) of the hippocampus, alongside associated memory impairments. However, only few pediatric studies have examined glucocorticoid associations with hippocampal subfield volumes and their functional relevance. In 84 children (age range: 6–7 years), we assessed whether volumes of hippocampal subregions were related to cumulative glucocorticoid levels (hair cortisol), parenting stress, and performance on memory tasks known to engage the hippocampus. We found that higher hair cortisol levels were specifically related to lower CA3-DG volume. Parenting stress did not significantly correlate with hair cortisol, and there was no evidence to suggest that individual differences in hippocampal subregional volumes manifest in memory performance. Our results suggest that the CA3-DG may be the hippocampal region most closely associated with hair cortisol levels in childhood. Establishing causal pathways underlying this association and its relation to environmental stress and memory development necessitates longitudinal studies.","2020-12","2022-03-23 12:03:22","2022-03-23 12:03:22","2022-03-23 12:03:22","4865","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\687Y42ZW\Keresztes et al. - 2020 - Hair cortisol concentrations are associated with h.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the analysis, the differences between age groups are interpreted as developmental differences. We argue that this approach is problematic because the variance in cognitive performance within an age group is considered to be measurement error. However, if a part of this variance is systematic, it can provide very useful information about the cognitive processes used by some children of a certain age but not others. In the current study, we presented 210 children aged 5 to 12 years with serial order short-term memory tasks. First we analyze our data according to the approach using age groups, and then we apply latent class analysis to form latent classes of children based on their performance instead of their ages. We display the results of the age groups and the latent classes in terms of serial position curves, and we discuss the differences in results. Our ﬁndings show that there are considerable differences in performance between the age groups and the latent classes. We interpret our ﬁndings as indicating that the latent class analysis yielded a much more meaningful way of grouping children in terms of cognitive processes than the a priori grouping of children based on their ages.

Early research with children (as young as 6–7 years) was consistent with boundary extension, but relied on an analysis of spatial errors in drawings which are open to alternative explanations (e.g. drawing ability). Experiment 1 replicated and extended prior drawing results with 4–5-year-olds and adults. In Experiment 2, a new, forced-choice immediate recognition memory test was implemented with the same children. On each trial, a card (photograph of a simple scene) was immediately replaced by a test card (identical view and either a closer or more wide-angle view) and participants indicated which one matched the original view. Error patterns supported boundary extension; identical photographs were more frequently rejected when the closer view was the original view, than vice versa. This asymmetry was not attributable to a selection bias (guessing tasks; Experiments 3–5). In Experiment 4, working memory load was increased by presenting more expansive views of more complex scenes. Again, children exhibited boundary extension, but now adults did not, unless stimulus duration was reduced to 5 s (limiting time to implement strategies; Experiment 5). We propose that like adults, children interpret photographs as views of places in the world; they extrapolate the anticipated continuation of the scene beyond the view and misattribute it to having been seen.

Children (n = 59; 8–19 years, 24 violence-exposed) completed an associative learning task with angry, happy, and neutral faces paired with objects during fMRI scanning. Outside the scanner, participants completed an associative memory test for face-object pairings. Violence-exposed children exhibited broad associative memory difficulties that became more pronounced with age, along with reduced recruitment of the hippocampus and atypical recruitment of fronto-parietal regions during encoding. Violence-exposed children also showed selective disruption of associative memory for threat cues regardless of age, along with reduced recruitment of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) during encoding in the presence of threat. Broad associative learning difficulties may be a functional consequence of the toxic effects of early-life stress on hippocampal and fronto-parietal cortical development. Difficulties in the presence of threat cues may result from enhanced threat processing that disrupts encoding and short-term storage of associative information in the IPS.

We found evidence for a long-axis encoding–retrieval specialization that declined linearly during development and aging, eventually vanishing in the older adults. This was mainly driven by age effects on retrieval, which was associated with gradually lower activity from childhood to adulthood, followed by positive age relationships until 70 years. This pattern of age effects characterized task engagement regardless of memory success or failure.

The hippocampus is comprised of several cytoarchitectural subﬁelds with functional signiﬁcance for episodic memory. However, hippocampal subﬁelds have not been assessed in vivo during child development, nor has their relation with episodic memory been assessed during this period. In the present study, high-resolution T2-weighted images of the hippocampus were acquired in 39 children and adolescents aged 8 to 14 years (M = 11.30, SD = 2.38), and hippocampal subﬁelds were segmented using a protocol previously validated in adult populations. We ﬁrst validated the method in children and adolescents and examined age-related differences in hippocampal subﬁelds and correlations between subﬁeld volumes and episodic memory. Signiﬁcant age-related increases in the subﬁeld volume were observed into early adolescence in the right CA3/DG and CA1. The right CA3/DG subﬁeld volumes were positively correlated with accurate episodic memory for item–color relations, and the right CA3/DG and subiculum were negatively correlated with item false alarm rates.

Memory for each relation and volumes of hippocampal subregions were assessed longitudinally in 171 participants across 3 time points (Mage at T1 ¼ 9.45 years; Mage at T2 ¼ 10.86 years, Mage at T3 ¼ 12.12 years; comprising 393 behavioral assessments and 362 structural scans). Among older children, volumetric growth in: (a) head and body predicted improvements in item-time memory, (b) head predicted improvements in item-item memory; and (c) right tail predicted improvements in item-space memory.

Two exploratory studies examined parent–child conversations about life chapters. In Study 1, mothers recorded naturalistic conversations with their 5–6 year old children about two chapters in the child’s life. In Study 2, mothers recorded conversations with their 6–7 year old children about a particular life chapter—the child’s kindergarten year—and also about a speciﬁc episode of their choice. The results indicated that young children are able to recall and discuss information about life chapters and that parents actively scaﬀold children’s discussion of general information in chapters as well as speciﬁc events. Mothers’ conversational style when discussing chapters (e.g., elaborativeness) predicted children’s memory contributions, and was also positively correlated with their style when discussing speciﬁc events.

However, few studies have investigated how children represent the complex structure of observed actions which underlies their imitation. We integrate theories of action segmentation, memory, and imitation to investigate whether children’s event representation is organized according to veridical serial order or a higher level goal structure. Children were randomly assigned to learn novel event sequences either through interactive hands-on experience (Study 1) or via storybook (Study 2). Results demonstrate that children’s representation of observed actions is organized according to higher level goals, even at the cost of representing the veridical temporal ordering of the sequence. We argue that prioritizing goal structure enhances event memory, and that this mental organization is a key mechanism of social-cognitive development in real-world, dynamic environments. It supports cultural learning and imitation in ecologically valid settings when social agents are multitasking and not demonstrating one isolated goal at a time.","2017-09","2022-03-23 12:04:25","2022-03-23 12:04:25","2022-03-23 12:04:25","1904-1933","","7","41","","Cogn Sci","Children's Representation and Imitation of Events","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\QSNNTAVD\Loucks et al. - 2017 - Children's Representation and Imitation of Events.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although a wealth of evidence indicates that children can process and represent temporal order in memory, relatively little is known about the development of this ability and the cognitive mechanisms that support it in the context of imitation. The present research investigated 4- through 8-year-old children’s ability to learn the temporal order of novel, arbitrary action sequences via imitation. On Day 1, children observed and imitated four instances each for two different multistep sequences. One sequence was easy and the other was difficult, in terms of categorizing the items used in each instance. For one sequence, the experimenter also performed one instance in a deviant temporal order, which occurred either early or late in learning. Memory generalization for each sequence was assessed on Day 2. Results indicated significant effects of age and sequence difficulty on children’s ability to recall the individual actions as well as the standard order. Experiencing the deviant order also uniquely disrupted children’s ability to generalize the order. Experiencing the deviant early in learning globally lowered children’s memory for both sequences. Thus, children’s ability to learn temporal order develops slowly over childhood, is supported by foundational cognitive processes that operate in a hierarchical fashion, and is highly sensitive to variable temporal input. These results have implications for theories of imitation and cultural learning more broadly.","2019-02","2022-03-23 12:04:27","2022-03-23 12:04:27","2022-03-23 12:04:27","263-273","","2","55","","Developmental Psychology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\2E4VZ6LH\Loucks and Price - 2019 - Memory for temporal order in action is slow develo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research suggests that backward causalinference errors are supported by recollection, whereas gap-filling errors are supported by familiarity. We hypothesized that age differences in these errors would parallel the developmental trajectories of these processes.

This study focuses on episodic memory encoding of verbal information by children, a cognitive domain not previously studied using fMRI. Methods: Children from 7 to 19 years of age were scanned at 1.5-T field strength using eventrelated fMRI while performing a novel verbal memory encoding paradigm in which words were incidentally encoded. A subsequent memory analysis was performed. SPM2 was utilized for whole brain and region-of-interest analyses of data. Both whole-sample intragroup analyses and intergroup analyses of the sample divided into 2 subgroups by age were conducted. Results: Importantly, behavioral memory performance was equal across the age range of children studied. Encoding-related activation in the left hippocampus and bilateral basal ganglia declined as age increased. In addition, while robust blood oxygen level–dependent signal was found in left prefrontal cortex with task performance, no encoding-related age-modulated prefrontal activation was observed in either hemisphere. Conclusion: These data are consistent with a developmental pattern of verbal memory encoding function in which left hippocampal and bilateral basal ganglionic activations are more robust earlier in childhood but then decline with age. No encoding-related activation was found in prefrontal cortex which may relate to this region’s recognized delay in biologic maturation in humans. These data represent the first fMRI demonstration of verbal encoding function in children and are relevant developmentally and clinically.

However, it remains unclear whether this effect stems from co-occurrence or other factors, and how co-occurrence contributes to generalization. To address these issues, preschoolers were exposed to a stream of semanticallysimilar labels that don’t co-occur in natural language, but were arranged to co-occur in the experimental setting. In Experiment 1, children exposed to the co-occurring stream were more likely to make category-consistent inferences than children in two control conditions. Experiment 2 replicated this effect and provided evidence that co-occurrence training influenced generalization only when the trained labels were categorically-similar. These findings suggest that both co-occurrence information and semantic representations contribute to preschool-age children’s inductive generalization.

No parietal old/new effect, the putative ERP correlate of recollection was obtained in the speeded condition in neither group. Conversely, in the nonspeeded condition, both groups showed the parietal old/new effect, and a frontal effect was additionally observed for adults.

Selecting an intrinsic reference frame requires remembering locations relative to nearby objects independent of one’s body (egocentric) or distal environmental (allocentric) cues, and does not reliably occur in children under 5 years of age (Nardini, Burgess, Breckenridge, & Atkinson, 2006). The current studies tested the relation between spatial language and 4-year-olds’ selection of an intrinsic reference frame in spatial recall. Experiment 1 showed that providing 4-year-olds with location-descriptive cues during (Exp. 1a) or before (Exp. 1b) the recall task improved performance both overall and speciﬁcally on trials relying most on an intrinsic reference frame. Additionally, children’s recall performance was predicted by their verbal descriptions of the task space (Exp. 1a control condition). Non-verbally highlighting relations among objects during the recall task (Exp. 2) supported children’s performance relative to the control condition, but signiﬁcantly less than the location-descriptive cues. These results suggest that the ability to verbally represent relations is a potential mechanism that could account for developmental changes in the selection of an intrinsic reference frame during spatial recall.","2016-05","2022-03-23 12:05:15","2022-03-23 12:05:15","2022-03-23 12:05:15","170-180","","","150","","Cognition","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\WYNWYPZZ\Miller et al. - 2016 - Language supports young children’s use of spatial .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often, this plasticity co-occurs with gains in hippocampal-dependent memory. Cross-sectional work investigating this relationship in preadolescent children has found behavioral differences in higher versus lower aerobically fit participants for tasks measuring relational memory, which is known to be critically tied to hippocampal structure and function. The present study tested whether similar differences would arise in a clinical intervention setting where a group of preadolescent children were randomly assigned to a nine-month after school aerobic exercise intervention versus a wait-list control group. Performance measures included eye-movements as a measure of memory, based on recent work linking eye-movement indices of relational memory to the hippocampus. Results indicated that only children in the intervention increased their aerobic fitness. Compared to the control group, those who entered the aerobic exercise program displayed eye-movement patterns indicative of superior memory for face-scene relations, with no differences observed in memory for individual faces. The results of this intervention study provide clear support for the proposed linkage among the hippocampus, relational memory, and aerobic fitness, as well as illustrating the sensitivity of eye-movement measures as a means of assessing memory.","2012-09","2022-03-23 12:05:22","2022-03-23 12:05:22","2022-03-23 12:05:22","1876-1882","","9","22","","Hippocampus","Aerobic fitness enhances relational memory in preadolescent children","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\Q2G5XIY3\Monti et al. - 2012 - Aerobic fitness enhances relational memory in prea.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One framework that describes the cognitive and neural development of children's growing learning abilities is the two-component model. It distinguishes processes that integrate separate features into a coherent memory representation (associative component) and executive abilities, such as elaboration, evaluation, and monitoring, that support memory processing (strategic component). In an fMRI study using an object-location association paradigm, we investigated how the two components influence memory performance across development. We tested children (10–12 years, n = 31), late adolescents (18 years, n = 29), and adults (25+ years, n = 30). For studying the associative component, we also probed how the utilisation of prior knowledge (schemas) facilitates memory across age groups. Children had overall lower retrieval performance, while adolescents and adults did not differ from each other. All groups benefitted from schemas, but this effect did not differ between groups. Performance differences between groups were associated with deactivation of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which in turn was linked to executive functioning. These patterns were stronger in adolescents and adults and seemed absent in children. Thus, the children's executive system, the strategic component, is not as mature and thus cannot facilitate memory performance in the same way as in adolescents/adults. In contrast, we did not find age-related differences in the associative component; with activity in the angular gyrus predicting memory performance systematically across groups. Overall, our results suggest that differences of executive rather than associative abilities explain memory differences between children, adolescents, and adults.","2021-12-15","2022-03-23 12:05:28","2022-03-23 12:05:29","2022-03-23 12:05:28","6000-6013","","18","42","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\BATE2TV6\Müller et al. - 2021 - Differences in executive abilities rather than ass.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results suggest that during development only a particular kind of theory of mind ability is integrated with episodic memory.","2003-08","2022-03-23 12:05:36","2022-03-23 12:05:36","2022-03-23 12:05:36","312-336","","4","85","","Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","The relationship between theory of mind and episodic memory","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\TMUGAL3M\Naito - 2003 - The relationship between theory of mind and episod.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In three experiments, we tested the development of memory for such contextual associations in a naturalistic setting. Children searched for toys in two rooms with two different experimenters; each room contained two identical sets of four containers, but arranged differently. A distinct toy was hidden in a distinct container in each room. In Experiment 1, which involved children between 15 and 26 months who were prompted with a very explicit cue (a part of the hidden toy), we found a marked shift in performance with age: while 15- to 20-month-olds concentrated their searches on the two containers that sometimes contained toys, they did not distinguish between them according to context, but 21–26-month-olds did. However, surprisingly, without toy cues, even the youngest children showed a fragile ability to disambiguate the two containers by room context. In Experiment 2, we tested 34- to 40-month-olds and 64- to 72-month-olds without toy cues. The 5-year-olds were nearly perfect, and the 3-year-olds showed a significant preference for the correct container given only the context. In Experiment 3, we filled in the age range, and also investigated the effects of the use of labels (i.e. names of experimenters and rooms) and of familiarization time, in groups of 34- to 40-month-olds, 42- to 48-month-olds, and 50- to 56-month-olds. Neither labels nor familiarization time had an effect. Across experiments, there was regular age-related improvement in context-based memory. Overall, the results suggest that children’s episodic memory may undergo an early qualitative change, yet to be precisely characterized, and that continuing increments in the use of contextual cues occur throughout the preschool period.","2014-09","2022-03-23 12:05:46","2022-03-23 12:05:46","2022-03-23 12:05:46","743-756","","5","17","","Dev Sci","Two rooms, two representations?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\F7GUVS4W\Newcombe et al. - 2014 - Two rooms, two representations Episodic-like memo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Key brain regions that supporting these processes include the hippocampus, portions of the parietal cortex, and portions of prefrontal cortex, each of which shows different developmental profiles. Here we asked whether developmental differences in the axonal pathways connecting these regions may account for the robust gains in episodic memory in young children. Using diffusion weighted imaging, we examined whether white matter connectivity between brain regions implicated in episodic memory differed with age, and were associated with memory performance differences in 4- and 6-year-old children. Results revealed that white matter connecting the hippocampus to the inferior parietal lobule significantly predicted children’s performance on episodic memory tasks. In contrast, variation in the white matter connecting the hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex did not relate to memory performance. These findings suggest that structural connectivity between the hippocampus and lateral parietal regions is relevant to the development of episodic memory.","2017-12","2022-03-23 12:05:49","2022-03-23 12:05:49","2022-03-23 12:05:49","41-53","","","28","","Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\VS4VG9KU\Ngo et al. - 2017 - White matter structural connectivity and episodic .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding these changes requires decomposing episodic memory into its components. Two such components are (a) mnemonic discrimination of similar people, objects, and contexts, and (b) relational binding of these elements. We designed novel memory tasks to assess these component processes using animations that are appropriate across the life span (ages 4 – 80 in our sample). In Experiment 1, we assessed mnemonic discrimination of objects as well as relational binding, in a common task format. Both components follow an inverted U-shaped curve across age but were positively correlated only in the aging group. In Experiment 2, we examined mnemonic discrimination of context and its effect on relational binding. Relational memory in low-similarity contexts showed robust gains between the ages of 4 and 6, whereas 6-year-olds performed similarly to adults. In contrast, relational memory in high-similarity contexts showed more protracted development, with 4- and 6-year-olds both performing worse than young adults and not differing from each other. Relational memory in both context conditions declined in aging. This multiprocess approach provides important theoretical insights into life span changes in episodic memory.","2019-09","2022-03-23 12:05:56","2022-03-23 12:05:56","2022-03-23 12:05:56","1463-1479","","9","148","","Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","Building up and wearing down episodic memory","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\G6FYHKYB\Ngo et al. - 2019 - Building up and wearing down episodic memory Mnem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many countries, including Germany, formal schooling begins in this age range. It is, thus, unclear to what extent exposure to formal schooling contributes to the “5-7 shift”. In this longitudinal study, we investigated if schooling acts as a catalyst of maturation. We tested 5-year-old children who were born close to the official cutoff date for school entry and who were still attending a play-oriented kindergarten. One year later, the children were tested again. Some of the children had experienced their first year of schooling whereas the others had remained in kindergarten. Using two fMRI tasks that assessed episodic memory formation (i.e., subsequent memory effect), we found that children relied strongly on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) at both time points but not on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In contrast, older children and adults typically show subsequent memory effects in both MTL and PFC. Both children groups improved in their memory performance, but there were no longitudinal changes nor group differences in neural activation. We conclude that successful memory formation in this age group relies more heavily on the MTL than in older age groups.","2021-07-05","2022-03-23 12:06:08","2022-03-23 12:06:09","2022-03-23 12:06:08","3764-3779","","8","31","","","Neural Correlates of Successful Memory Encoding in Kindergarten and Early Elementary School Children","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\SM5GVTUS\Nolden et al. - 2021 - Neural Correlates of Successful Memory Encoding in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During a learning phase children had to learn paired associates. In the test phase, children performed a recognition task and choose the correct associate for a given target among four possible answers. Subsequently, children’s explicit conﬁdence judgments (CJs) and their ﬁxation time allocation at the conﬁdence scale were assessed. Analyses showed that explicit CJs did not differ for remembered compared to non-remembered items. In contrast, children’s ﬁxation patterns on the conﬁdence scale were affected by the correctness of their memory, as children looked longer to high conﬁdence ratings when they correctly remembered the associated item. Moreover, analyses of pupil size revealed pupil dilations for correctly remembered, but not incorrectly remembered items. The results converge with recent behavioral ﬁndings that reported evidence for implicit metacognitive memory monitoring processes in 3.5-year-old children.

The ability to suppress retrieval of unwanted memories has been documented in behavioral and neuroimaging research using the Think/No-Think (TNT) paradigm with adults. Attempts to stop memory retrieval are associated with increased activation of lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and concomitant reduced activation in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. However, the extent to which children have the ability to actively suppress their memories is unknown.This study investigated memory suppression in middle childhood using the TNT paradigm. Forty children aged 8–12 and 30 young adults were instructed either to remember (Think) or suppress (No-Think) the memory of the second word of previously studied word-pairs, when presented with the ﬁrst member as a reminder. They then performed two different cued recall tasks, testing their memory for the second word in each pair after the TNT phase using the same ﬁrst studied word within the pair as a cue (intra-list cue) and also an independent cue (extra-list cue). Children exhibited age-related improvements in memory suppression from age 8 to 12 in both memory tests, against a backdrop of overall improvements in declarative memory over this age range. These ﬁndings suggest that memory suppression is an active process that develops during late childhood, likely due to an age-related reﬁnement in the ability to engage PFC to down-regulate activity in areas involved in episodic retrieval.","2009","2022-03-23 12:07:34","2022-03-23 12:07:35","2022-03-23 12:07:34","","","","3","","Front.

A sample of 8- to 9-year-olds and adults (               N               = 31) was assessed with the Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, known to induce high levels of false recognition of lures that are semantically associated with studied items. The strength of semantic association among list items was manipulated. Relative to children, adults correctly recognized more studied items and falsely recognized more critical lures. High-association lists resulted in higher recognition of both studied items and critical lures. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that, overall, true recognition was supported by coupling within two hippocampal-temporal and fronto-parietal set of regions; in contrast, coupling among more distributed hippocampal-temporal-parietal-frontal regions was observed during false recognition. Critically, adults, compared to children, exhibited stronger hippocampal/parietal coupling and stronger hippocampal/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) coupling for veridical recognition of high-associative strength items. In contrast, children, compared to adults, exhibited stronger hippocampus/ventrolateral PFC coupling and stronger bilateral middle-temporal gyrus/ventrolateral PFC coupling for high-associative strength critical lures. Our results underscored a role for the anterior hippocampus in true and false recognition, showing different functional patterns as a function of age and association strength.

Forty-two children aged 7–13 years were asked to recall semantic information and episodic events from three diﬀerent time periods (current school year, last school year, and previous school years). For the recalls of all events, sense of remembering or sense of just knowing was measured via the Remember/Know paradigm. Age-related diﬀerences were observed for episodic autobiographical memory whereas semantic autobiographical memory was characterized by a relative developmental invariance. The increase with age was also found in the number of ‘‘Remember’’ responses and their justiﬁcation in terms of the actual contextual information retrieved—factual, spatial, and, more especially, temporal details. These ﬁndings highlight developmental diﬀerences between the episodic and semantic subcomponents of autobiographical memory and support the view that mental ‘time travel’ through subjective time, which allows one to re-experience the past through self-awareness, is the last feature of autobiographical memory to become fully operational.","2007-03","2022-03-23 12:08:30","2022-03-23 12:08:30","2022-03-23 12:08:29","84-101","","1","16","","Consciousness and Cognition","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\9QPX6CUZ\Piolino et al. - 2007 - Do school-age children remember or know the person.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study demonstrated that the type of question used to test memory (cued-recall versus yes/no questions) could account for the different reported conclusions. Children aged 5–6 years took part in an event either once or four times. Three or 21 days later, they were given a suggestive interview about the single/ﬁnal occurrence of the event during which half of the event details were inaccurately described. When later asked yes/no questions, the children with repeated experience agreed with more of the suggestions than did those in the single-experience condition, especially at the longer delay. In relation to cued-recall questions, however, experience did not mediate the number of times that false suggestions from the biasing interview were reported.

Model-based analyses provided insight regarding the type of strategy being used to solve the categorization task, demonstrating that the use of the task appropriate strategy increased with age. When children and adults who identified the correct categorization rule were compared, the performance deficit was no longer evident. Executive functions were also measured. While both working memory and inhibitory control were related to rule-based categorization and improved with age, working memory specifically was found to marginally mediate the age-related improvements in categorization. When analyses focused only on the sample of children, results showed that working memory ability and inhibitory control were associated with categorization performance and strategy use. The current findings track changes in categorization performance across childhood, demonstrating at which points performance begins to mature and resemble that of adults.

However, empirical evidence demonstrating these putative links is lacking. We assessed the diurnal cortisol awakening response (CAR) on two mornings and cortisol stress reactivity (CSR) with the Trier Social Stress Test for Children in 102 healthy, socio–demographically diverse 6–to–7–year–old children (46% female). Children performed a hippocampal–dependent item–location associative memory task and 60 of these children underwent structural MRI scanning for hippocampal volume. Cortisol values were modeled with latent–change structural equation models to represent overall levels and change. We found lower income is associated with a ﬂatter CAR, blunted reactivity and recovery to acute stress, and smaller hippocampal volume. Furthermore, hyporeactivity in CSR was related to lower memory among lower–income children, whereas there was no reliable association of CSR and memory among higher–income children (an income x cortisol interaction). We found no evidence that smaller hippocampal volume in lower income was associated with poorer memory performance. Notably, hyporeactivity in both CAR and CSR was speciﬁc to using income as the SES predictor. The income x cortisol interaction and smaller hippocampal eﬀects, however, were replicated with education and an SES composite score. This suggests that hyporeactivity to acute stress may function as a mediator in SES–cognition associations at the lower end of the SES spectrum, but it does not imply environmental– or genetically–mediated causation.","2018-04","2022-03-23 12:09:27","2022-03-23 12:09:27","2022-03-23 12:09:26","110-121","","","90","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\M3WFQT5A\Raffington et al. - 2018 - Blunted cortisol stress reactivity in low–income c.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were 142 6–to–7–year–old children, of which 127 returned when they were 8–to–9 years old. Longitudinal analyses indicated that the association of family income with children’s memory per­ formance and hippocampal volume remained stable over this age range and did not predict change. On average, children from economically disadvantaged background showed lower memory performance and had a smaller hippocampal volume. There was no evidence to suggest that differences in memory performance were mediated by differences in hippocampal volume.

Previous research from different laboratories reported that basic allocentric spatial memory abilities are reliably observed in children after 2 years of age. Based on work performed in monkeys and rats, we had proposed that the functional maturation of direct entorhinal cortex projections to the CA1 field of the hippocampus might underlie the emergence of basic allocentric spatial memory. We also proposed that the protracted development of the dentate gyrus and its projections to the CA3 field of the hippocampus might underlie the development of high-resolution allocentric spatial memory capacities, based on the essential contribution of these structures to the process known as pattern separation. Here, we present an experiment designed to assess the development of spatial pattern separation capacities and its impact on allocentric spatial memory performance in children from 18 to 48 months of age. We found that: (1) allocentric spatial memory performance improved with age, (2) as compared to younger children, a greater number of children older than 36 months advanced to the final stage requiring the highest degree of spatial resolution, and (3) children that failed at different stages exhibited difficulties in discriminating locations that required higher spatial resolution abilities. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that improvements in human spatial memory performance might be linked to improvements in pattern separation capacities.","2015-07","2022-03-23 12:09:57","2022-03-23 12:09:57","2022-03-23 12:09:57","318-331","","4","39","","International Journal of Behavioral Development","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\QFLMSPNM\Lambert et al. - 2015 - Improvement of allocentric spatial memory resoluti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three cohorts of children (aged 4, 6, or 8 years) were followed longitudinally for 3 years. Each year, children completed a source memory paradigm assessing memory for items and binding. Results suggest linear increases in memory for individual items (facts or sources) between 4 and 10 years of age but that memory for correct fact/source combinations (indicative of binding) showed accelerated rates of change between 5 and 7 years. Taken together, these results suggest differences exist in developmental trajectories between the development of memory processes underlying successful item memory and processes underlying binding. Implications of these findings are discussed in relation to longitudinal research examining autobiographical memory.","2014","2022-03-23 12:10:08","2022-03-23 12:10:08","2022-03-23 12:10:08","449-459","","2","50","","Developmental Psychology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\NV7GD933\Riggins - 2014 - Longitudinal investigation of source memory reveal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have shown that age-related differences in specialization along the longitudinal axis of this structure (i.e., subregions) and within its internal circuitry (i.e., subﬁelds) relate to age-related improvements in memory in school-age children and adults. However, the inﬂuence of age on hippocampal development and its relations with memory ability earlier in life remains under-investigated. This study examined effects of age and sex on hippocampal subregion (i.e., head, body, tail) and subﬁeld (i.e., subiculum, CA1, CA2-4/DG) volumes, and their relations with memory, using a large sample of 4- to 8-year-old children. Results examining hippocampal subregions suggest inﬂuences of both age and sex on the hippocampal head during early childhood. Results examining subﬁelds within hippocampal head suggest these age effects may arise from CA1, whereas sex differences may arise from subiculum and CA2-4/DG. Memory ability was not associated with hippocampal subregion volume but was associated with subﬁeld volume. Speciﬁcally, within the hippocampal head, relations between memory and CA1 were moderated by age; in younger children bigger was better, whereas in older children smaller was superior. Within the hippocampal body, smaller CA1 and larger CA2-4/DG contributed to better memory performance across all ages. Together, these results shed light on hippocampal development during early childhood and support claims that the prolonged developmental trajectory of the hippocampus contributes to memory development early in life.","2018-07","2022-03-23 12:10:21","2022-03-23 12:10:21","2022-03-23 12:10:21","127-137","","","174","","NeuroImage","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\4TT9D36Y\Riggins et al. - 2018 - Protracted hippocampal development is associated w.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Children were randomly assigned to either the Difference condition (they were asked to pay attention to differences between the 2 events), the Memory control condition (asked to pay attention with no reference to differences), or the No-Instruction control (no special instructions were given). One week later, during a structured interview about the photography session, the 3- to 4-year-olds in the NoInstruction condition were less accurate and responded more often with ‘do not know’ than the 7- to 8-year-olds. However, the older children in the Difference condition made more source confusions than the younger children suggesting improved memory for content but not source. In Study 2, the Difference condition was replaced by a Difference-Tag condition where details were pointed out along with their source (i.e., tagging source to content). Ninety-four children aged 3 to 8 years participated. Children in the Difference-Tag condition made fewer source-monitoring errors than children in the Control condition.

The current research examines possible mechanisms underlying these auditory dominance effects in infants and 4-year-olds. Do auditory dominance effects stem from auditory input attenuating encoding of visual input, from the difficulty of inhibiting auditory-based responses, or from a combination of these factors. In five reported experiments, 4-year-olds (Experiments 1A - 2B) and 14- and 22-month-olds (Experiment 3) were presented with a variety of tasks that required simultaneous processing of auditory and visual input and then we assessed memory for the visual items at test. Auditory dominance in young children resulted from response competition that children could not resolve. The infant results were not as robust, but provided some evidence that nonlinguistic sounds and possibly spoken words may attenuate encoding of visual input. The current findings shed light on mechanisms underlying cross-modal processing and auditory dominance and have implications on many tasks that hinge on the processing of arbitrary, auditory-visual pairings.","2019-02","2022-03-23 12:10:46","2022-03-23 12:10:46","2022-03-23 12:10:46","317-340","","","178","","Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","Two mechanisms underlying auditory dominance","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\3GMB2CBS\Robinson and Sloutsky - 2019 - Two mechanisms underlying auditory dominance Over.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Children, adolescents, and adults performed Tulving’s (1985) remember/know paradigm while ERPs were recorded during memory encoding (Experiment 1) and retrieval (Experiment 2). Behaviorally, children recognized fewer items than adolescents and adults. All age groups reliably made subjective judgments of recollection, although the ability to make these judgments improved with age. At encoding, the ERP effect associated with recollection was present and comparable across age groups. In contrast, the ERP effect associated with recollection at retrieval differed as a function of age group; specifically, this effect was absent in children, topographically widespread in adolescents, and, consistent with previous literature, maximal over left centro-­parietal leads in adults. These findings suggest that encoding processes associated with the subsequent subjective experience of recollection may be similar among children, adolescents, and adults and that age-­related improvement in recollection may be primarily attributable to the development of processes that follow the initial encoding of stimuli (i.e., consolidation, storage, retrieval).","2018-05","2022-03-23 12:10:54","2022-03-23 12:10:54","2022-03-23 12:10:54","e12583","","3","21","","Dev Sci","Age-related differences in subjective recollection","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\2V33GW6A\Rollins and Riggins - 2018 - Age-related differences in subjective recollection.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent work, however, additionally suggests a role for visual association cortex in the formation of associative memories. This study investigated the role of category-preferential visual processing regions in associative memory across development using a paired associate learning task in a sample of 56 youths (age 6–19 years). Participants were asked to bind an emotional face with an object while undergoing fMRI scanning. Outside the scanner, participants completed a memory test. We first investigated age-related changes in neural recruitment and found linear age-related increases in activation in lateral occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus, which are involved in visual processing of objects and faces, respectively. Furthermore, greater activation in these visual processing regions was associated with better subsequent memory for pairs over and above the effect of age and of hippocampal and pFC activation on performance. Recruitment of these visual processing regions mediated the association between age and memory performance, over and above the effects of hippocampal activation. Taken together, these findings extend the existing literature to suggest that greater recruitment of category-preferential visual processing regions during encoding of associative memories is a neural mechanism explaining improved memory across development.","2018-03","2022-03-23 12:10:56","2022-03-23 12:10:56","2022-03-23 12:10:56","365-380","","3","30","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\SLSZMPSC\Rosen et al. - 2018 - The Role of Visual Association Cortex in Associati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated the associations of these environmental characteristics with associative memory, cued attention, and memory-guided attention in a sample of 101 children aged 60–75 months. We further investigated whether these specific cognitive abilities mediated the association between SES and academic achievement 18 months later.

Here, we present 4 experiments investigating representations of regular and exceptional category members as well as potential developmental changes in these representations. Although 4-year-olds and adults demonstrated different memory patterns, both age groups showed (a) higher memory sensitivity for regular members of the category and (b) isomorphic memory patterns for regular and exception items. Additionally, we report important developmental differences in generalization patterns. In children, features of regulars and of exceptions contributed to categorization of both regular and exception items. In contrast, an asymmetry was found in adults: features of regulars contributed to categorization of both regular and exception items, whereas features of exceptions contribution only to categorization of exceptions. These findings challenge the hypothesis that items that violate known knowledge structures have a special status in memory and suggest that exceptions can be represented jointly with regular items early in development and as a subset of regular items later in development.","2019-06","2022-03-23 12:11:26","2022-03-23 12:11:26","2022-03-23 12:11:26","1071-1090","","6","148","","Journal of Experimental Psychology: General","Assimilation of exceptions?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\7MFAGNMD\Savic and Sloutsky - 2019 - Assimilation of exceptions Examining representati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we relate individual differences in volumes along the hippocampal long axis to performance on statistical learning and associative inference tasks—both of which require encoding associations that span multiple episodes—in a developmental sample ranging from ages 6 to 30 years. Relating age to volume, we found dissociable patterns across the hippocampal long axis, with opposite nonlinear volume changes in the head and body. These structural differences were paralleled by performance gains across the age range on both tasks, suggesting improvements in the cross-episode binding ability from childhood to adulthood. Controlling for age, we also found that smaller hippocampal heads were associated with superior behavioral performance on both tasks, consistent with this region's hypothesized role in forming generalized codes spanning events. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of examining hippocampal development as a function of position along the hippocampal axis and suggest that the hippocampal head is particularly important in encoding associative structure across development.","2017-01-01","2022-03-23 12:11:41","2022-03-23 12:11:41","2022-03-23 12:11:41","37-51","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\T7DSSTAH\Schlichting et al. - 2017 - Hippocampal Structure Predicts Statistical Learnin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results revealed that children across ages were appropriately sensitive to these cues without following them blindly and indiscriminately. Furthermore, individual differences in metamemory monitoring predicted overall accuracy improvements after receiving cues in 9-year-olds but not in 5- and 7year-olds, revealing a developmental role of metamemory for discerning when cues are most informative or needed. Although 5year-olds increased overall conﬁdence in their memory after receiving invalid cues, they still preserved the capacity to monitor their memory in the face of inaccurate information.

We investigated developmental changes in functional activation associated with episodic retrieval (correct item-context > incorrect item-context contrast) and asked whether pubertal changes contributed to developmental changes in pattern of activation. Non-linear developmental trajectories were observed. In the hippocampus, activation decreased with age during childhood and then increased into early adolescence. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, activation was largely absent initially, but quickly accelerated over time. Independent of age, changes in pubertal status additionally predicted increases in item-context activation in initially older children, and decreases in initially younger children across both regions and two indicators of puberty: the Pubertal Development Scale and salivary testosterone. These findings suggest that changes in both age and pubertal status uniquely contribute to memory-related activation, and the timing of pubertal onset may play an important role in the neural mechanisms supporting memory retrieval.","2019-04","2022-03-23 12:12:06","2022-03-23 12:12:06","2022-03-23 12:12:06","100599","","","36","","Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience","Longitudinal trajectories of hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to episodic retrieval","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\PNM7MT29\Selmeczy et al. - 2019 - Longitudinal trajectories of hippocampal and prefr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of behavioral and neural evidence, the authors hypothesized that the two components are functionally related but follow different life-span gradients. In a fully crossed design, age differences in recognition memory for single words versus word pairs (associative demand manipulation) were examined under instructions that emphasized item, pair, or elaborative-pair encoding (strategy manipulation). As predicted, the results showed that the strategic and associative components follow different life-span trajectories. Relative to younger adults, children’s difficulties in episodic memory primarily reflected lower levels of strategic functioning. In contrast, older adults showed impairments in both strategic and associative components.

Here, we compared children (aged 9–10 years), adolescents (aged 12–13 years), and young adults (aged 19–25 years) on their ability to form integration across overlapping associations in memory. Participants first encoded a set of overlapping, direct AB- and BCassociations (object-face and face-object pairs) as well as non-overlapping, unique DEassociations. They were then tested on these associations and inferential AC-associations. The experiment consisted of four such encoding/retrieval cycles, each consisting of different stimuli set. For accuracy on both unique and inferential associations, young adults were found to outperform teenagers, who in turn outperformed children. However, children were particularly slower than teenagers and young adults in making judgements during inferential than during unique associations. This suggests that children may rely more on making inferences during retrieval, by first retrieving the direct associations, followed by making the inferential judgement. Furthermore, young adults showed a higher correlation between accuracy in direct (AB, BC) and inferential AC-associations than children. This suggests that, young adults relied closely on AB- and BC-associations for making AC decisions, potentially by forming integrated ABC-triplets during encoding or retrieval. Taken together, our findings suggest that there may be an age-related shift in how information is integrated across experienced episodes, namely from relying on making inferences at retrieval during middle childhood to forming integrated representations at different memory processing stages in adulthood.","2019-04-22","2022-03-23 12:12:18","2022-03-23 12:12:19","2022-03-23 12:12:18","e0215848","","4","14","","PLoS ONE","Integrating across memory episodes","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\5IMW8ACV\Shing et al. - 2019 - Integrating across memory episodes Developmental .pdf","","","","Souza, Alessandra S.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By one account, the advantages of spaced learning should be independent of task particulars and previous learning experiences given that spacing effects have been demonstrated in a variety of tasks across the lifespan. However, by another account, spaced learning should be affected by previous learning because past learning affects the memory and attention processes that form the crux of the spacing effect. The current study investigated whether individuals’ learning histories affect the role of spacing in category learning. We examined the effect of spacing on 24 2- to 3.5-year-old children’s learning of categories organized by properties to which children’s previous learning experiences have biased them to attend (i.e., shape) and properties to which children are less biased to attend (i.e., texture and color). Spaced presentations led to signiﬁcantly better learning of shape categories, but not of texture or color categories, compared with massed presentations. In addition, generalized estimating equations analyses revealed positive relations between the size of children’s ‘‘shapeside” productive vocabularies and their shape category learning and between the size of children’s ‘‘against-the-system” productive vocabularies and their texture category learning. These results suggest that children’s attention to and memory for novel object categories are strongly related to their individual word-learning histories. Moreover, children’s learned attentional biases affected the types of categories for which spacing facilitated learning.","2017-07","2022-03-23 12:12:31","2022-03-23 12:12:31","2022-03-23 12:12:31","34-49","","","159","","Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","Consider the category","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\6KMMCV8R\Slone and Sandhofer - 2017 - Consider the category The effect of spacing depen.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiment 1 demonstrates that after performing an induction task, 5-year-olds exhibit more accurate memory than adults. Experiment 2 indicates that after 5-year-olds are trained to perform induction in an adultlike manner, their memory accuracy drops to the level of adults.

Different theoretical views offer different answers to these questions. Six experiments with 4- and 5-year-olds, 7-year-olds and adults (N = 208) test these competing theories by teaching categories for which category membership and perceptual similarity are in conﬂict, and varying orthogonally conceptual and attentional factors that may potentially affect inductive inference. The results suggest that early induction is similarity-based; conceptual information plays a negligible role in early induction, but its role increases gradually, with the 7-year-olds being a transitional group. And ﬁnally, there is substantial contribution of attention to the development of induction: only adults, but not children, could perform category-based induction without attentional support. Therefore, category-based induction exhibits protracted development, with attentional factors contributing early in development and conceptual factors contributing later in development. These results are discussed in relation to existing theories of development of inductive inference and broader theoretical views on cognitive development.","2015-11","2022-03-23 12:12:54","2022-03-23 12:12:54","2022-03-23 12:12:54","1-31","","","82","","Cognitive Psychology","Conceptual influences on induction","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\2MH89VK8\Sloutsky et al. - 2015 - Conceptual influences on induction A case for a l.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How do children solve this problem? Some have argued that word learning is achieved by means of inference: young word learners rely on a number of assumptions that reduce the overall hypothesis space by favoring some meanings over others. However, these approaches have difficulty explaining how words are learned from conversations or text, without pointing or explicit instruction. In this research, we propose an associative mechanism that can account for such learning. In a series of experiments, 4-year-olds and adults were presented with sets of words that included a single nonsense word (e.g. dax). Some lists were taxonomic (i.,e., all items were members of a given category), some were associative (i.e., all items were associates of a given category, but not members), and some were mixed. Participants were asked to indicate whether the nonsense word was an animal or an artifact. Adults exhibited evidence of learning when lists consisted of either associatively or taxonomically related items. In contrast, children exhibited evidence of word learning only when lists consisted of associatively related items. These results present challenges to several extant models of word learning, and a new model based on the distinction between syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations is proposed.","2017-09","2022-03-23 12:12:57","2022-03-23 12:12:57","2022-03-23 12:12:57","1-30","","","97","","Cognitive Psychology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\2AXTLITS\Sloutsky et al. - 2017 - An associative account of the development of word .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study aimed to test the assertion of an age-dependent shift in implicit versus explicit learning within a theoretical framework that explains the link between implicit sequence memory and word-form acquisition, using the Hebb repetition paradigm. We conducted a one-year, multiple-session longitudinal study in which we presented auditory sequences of syllables, copresented with pictures of aliens, for immediate serial recall by a group of children (8-9 years) and by an adult group. The repetition of one Hebb sequence was explicitly announced, while the repetition of another Hebb sequence was unannounced and, therefore, implicit. Despite their overall inferior recall performance, the children showed better offline retention of the implicit Hebb sequence, compared with adults who showed a significant decrement across the delays. Adults had gained more explicit knowledge of the implicit sequence than children, but this could not explain the age-dependent decline in the delayed memory for it. There was no significant age-effect for delayed memory of the explicit Hebb sequence, with both age groups showing retention. Overall performance by adults was positively correlated with measures of post-learning awareness. Performance by children was positively correlated with vocabulary knowledge. We conclude that children outperform adults in the retention over time of implicitly learned phonological sequences that will gradually consolidate into novel word-forms. The findings are discussed in the light of maturational differences for implicit versus explicit memory systems that also play a role in language acquisition.","2018-09","2022-03-23 12:13:06","2022-03-23 12:13:06","2022-03-23 12:13:06","e12634","","5","21","","Dev Sci","Children retain implicitly learned phonological sequences better than adults","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\PHFAZTQB\Smalle et al. - 2018 - Children retain implicitly learned phonological se.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whether dif­ ferences in this indirect measure of memory formation relate to lifespan differences in memory specificity has not yet been established. In the present study, we examined repetition effects in event-related potentials and their relation to recognition. During incidental encoding, children (aged 7–9 years), young adults (18–30 years), and older adults (65–76 years) viewed repeated object images from different categories. During subsequent recog­ nition, we distinguished memory for the specific items versus the general categories. We identified repetition suppression in all age groups, and repetition enhancement for adults. Furthermore, individual item recognition performance comprising lure discrimination was positively associated with the magnitude of the neural repe­ tition effects, which did not differ between groups, indicating common neural mechanisms of memory formation. Our findings demonstrate that neural repetition effects reflect the formation of highly specific memory repre­ sentations and highlight their significance as a neural indicator of individual differences in episodic memory encoding across the lifespan.","2021-04","2022-03-23 12:13:18","2022-03-23 12:13:18","2022-03-23 12:13:18","100926","","","48","","Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\IPLMX3VH\Sommer et al. - 2021 - Memory specificity is linked to repetition effects.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until recently, such spontaneous memories had only been examined in non-controlled settings (e.g., diary studies). Using a novel experimental paradigm, a previous study has shown that when young children are brought back to a highly distinct setting (same room, same experimenter, same furnishing), in which they previously experienced an interesting event (a Teddy or a Game event), spontaneous memories can be triggered. However, exactly which cues (or combination of cues) are effective for the children’s memory, remains unknown. Here, we used this novel paradigm to examine the possible impact of contextual cues at the time of retrieval. We manipulated whether the 35-month-old children returned to the same room (n = 40) or to a different, but similarly furnished, room (n = 40) after one week. The results revealed that although the children returning to a new room produced fewer spontaneous memories than the children returning to the same room, the difference was not significant. Interestingly, despite changing rooms, the children still produced spontaneous memories. Taken together the results may shed new light on the mechanisms underlying childhood amnesia.","2019-01-02","2022-03-23 12:13:20","2022-03-23 12:13:20","2022-03-23 12:13:20","38-48","","1","27","","Memory","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\7WERTEDQ\Sonne et al. - 2019 - Thirty-five-month-old children have spontaneous me.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When tested, participants often falsely report the critical target even though it was not on the original study list. Although this procedure has been used extensively with adults, few researchers have employed the DRM task with children. The present experiment explored how children and adults perform in the DRM paradigm when the length of the study list is manipulated. Children and adults studied eight DRM lists comprising either seven words (short-list condition) or 14 words (long-list condition). Adults recalled a larger proportion of studied words in both list length conditions. In the long-list condition, adults falsely recalled signiﬁcantly more critical targets than children. In the short-list condition, rates of false recall did not differ. A similar pattern emerged in the recognition data, with adults obtaining a higher rate of false recognition than children in the long-list condition, but not in the short list condition. Overall, long lists produced more false memories than short lists. We conclude that studying longer lists led to greater activation of the critical target in adults, whereas children received little additional activation from longer lists.

Neuroimaging studies of adult visuomotor sequence learning have associated fronto-striatal brain regions with implicit learning of spatial sequences. Given evidence of continued development in these brain regions during childhood, we compare implicit sequence learning in adults and 7- to 11-year-old children to examine potential developmental differences in the recruitment of fronto-striatal circuitry during implicit learning. Participants performed a standard serial reaction time task. Stimuli alternately followed a fixed 10-step sequence of locations or were presented in a pseudorandom order of locations. Adults outperformed children, achieving a significantly larger sequence learning effect and showing learning more quickly than children. Age-related differences in activity were observed in the premotor cortex, putamen, hippocampus, inferotemporal cortex, and parietal cortex. We observed differential recruitment of cortical and subcortical motor systems between groups, presumably reflecting age differences in motor response execution. Adults showed greater hippocampal activity for sequence trials, whereas children demonstrated greater signal during random trials. Activity in the right caudate correlated significantly with behavioral measures of implicit learning for both age groups, although adults showed greater signal change than children overall, as would be expected given developmental differences in sequence learning magnitude. These results challenge the idea of developmental invariance in implicit learning and instead support a view of parallel developments in implicit and explicit learning systems.","2004-10-01","2022-03-23 12:13:46","2022-03-23 12:13:46","2022-03-23 12:13:46","1339-1351","","8","16","","","Evidence of Developmental Differences in Implicit Sequence Learning","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\TFPDISR2\Thomas et al. - 2004 - Evidence of Developmental Differences in Implicit .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, the proportion of memories reported before the age of 3 years was greater for the children and adolescents relative to the adults. In addition, the single earliest memory reported by children and adolescents was at a younger age than that reported by adults. In fact, the earliest memories reported by the children and adolescents, but not the adults, were significantly younger than the traditional 3 1⁄2-year-old boundary of childhood amnesia. Regardless of the age of the rememberer, participants’ early memories had the same episodic characteristics.

The goal of the current research was to address several methodological shortcomings of prior studies on the development of semantic organization, by using a variant of the spatial arrangement method (SpAM) to collect graded judgments of relatedness for a set of entities that can be cross-classiﬁed into either taxonomic or thematic groups. In Experiment 1, we used the cross-classify SpAM (CC–SpAM) to obtain graded relatedness judgments and derive a representation of developmental changes in the organization of semantic knowledge. In Experiment 2, we validated the ﬁndings of Experiment 1 by using a more traditional pairwise similarity judgment paradigm. Across both experiments, we found that an early recognition of links between entities that are both taxonomically and thematically related preceded an increasing recognition of links based on a single type of relation.

To date, accounts of the origins of semantic organization have largely overlooked how sensitivity to statistical regularities ubiquitous in the environment may play a powerful role in shaping semantic development. The goal of the present research was to investigate how associations in the form of statistical regularities with which labels for concepts co-occur in language (e.g., sock and foot) and taxonomic relatedness (e.g., sock and pajamas) shape semantic organization of 4–5-year-olds and adults. To examine these aspects of semantic organization across development, we conducted three experiments examining eﬀects of cooccurrence and taxonomic relatedness on cued recall (Experiment 1), word-picture matching (Experiment 2), and looking dynamics in a Visual World paradigm (Experiment 3).

More recently, online reaction time (RT) measures and alternative ofﬂine question types have been developed to further investigate learning during exposure and more adequately assess individual differences in adults (Siegelman et al., 2017b, 2018). We assessed the usefulness of these measures for investigating VSL in early-school-aged children. Secondarily, we examined the effect of introducing a cover task, potentially affecting attention, on children’s VSL performance. Fifty-three children (aged 5–8 years) performed a self-paced VSL task containing triplets, in which participants determine the presentation speed and RTs to each stimulus are recorded. Half of the participants performed a cover task, while the other half did not. Online sensitivity to the statistical structure was measured by contrasting RTs to unpredictable versus predictable elements. Subsequently, participants completed 2-AFC (choose correct triplet) and 3-AFC (ﬁll blank to complete triplet) ofﬂine questions. RTs were signiﬁcantly longer for unpredictable than predictable elements, so we conclude that early-school-aged children are sensitive to the statistical structure during exposure, and that the RT task can measure that. We found no evidence as to whether children can perform above chance on ofﬂine 2-AFC or 3-AFC questions, or whether the cover task affects children’s VSL performance. These results show the feasibility of using an online RT task when assessing VSL in early-school-aged children. This task therefore seems suitable for future studies that aim to investigate VSL across development or in clinical populations, perhaps together with behavioral tasks.","2019-09-13","2022-03-23 12:14:18","2022-03-23 12:14:18","2022-03-23 12:14:18","2051","","","10","","Front.

Indeed, studies have demonstrated that children with dyslexia experience problems with SL, but the extent of the problems is unclear. We aimed to examine the performance of children with and without dyslexia across three distinct paradigms using both on- and offline measures, thereby tapping into different aspects of SL. 100 children with and without dyslexia (aged 8–11, 50 per group) completed three SL tasks: serial reaction time (SRT), visual statistical learning (VSL), and auditory nonadjacent dependency learning (A-NADL). Learning was measured through online reaction times during exposure in all tasks, and through offline questions in the VSL and A-NADL tasks. We find significant learning effects in all three tasks, from which we conclude that, collapsing over groups, children are sensitive to the statistical structures presented in the SRT, VSL and A-NADL tasks. No significant interactions of learning effect with group were found in any of the tasks, so we cannot conclude whether or not children with dyslexia perform differently on the SL tasks than their TD peers. These results are discussed in light of the proposed SL deficit in dyslexia.","2019-08-05","2022-03-23 12:14:21","2022-03-23 12:14:22","2022-03-23 12:14:21","e0220041","","8","14","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\NEFPPBLA\van Witteloostuijn et al. - 2019 - Statistical learning abilities of children with dy.pdf","","","","Gabay, Yafit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Experiment 1, children integrated the stem facts at Session 1 and retained the self-generated memory traces over 1 week.

As such, it is crucial that the contents of semantic memory remain accessible over time. Although memory for knowledge learned through direct observation has been investigated previously, we know very little about the retention of knowledge derived through integration of information acquired across separate learning episodes. The current research investigated cross-episode integration in 4-year-old children. Participants were presented with novel facts via distinct story episodes and tested for knowledge extension through cross-episode integration as well as for retention of the information over a 1-week delay. In Experiment 1, children retained the self-derived knowledge over the delay, although performance was primarily evidenced in a forced-choice format. In Experiment 2, we sought to facilitate the accessibility and robustness of self-derived knowledge by providing a verbal reminder after the delay. The accessibility of self-derived knowledge increased irrespective of whether participants successfully demonstrated knowledge of the integration facts during the ﬁrst visit. The results suggest that knowledge extended through integration remains accessible after delays even in a population where this learning process is less robust. The ﬁndings also demonstrate the facilitative effect of reminders on the accessibility and further extension of knowledge over extended time periods.","2016-05","2022-03-23 12:14:29","2022-03-23 12:14:29","2022-03-23 12:14:29","48-63","","","145","","Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","Integrating across episodes","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\H4Y2JTR4\Varga et al. - 2016 - Integrating across episodes Investigating the lon.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a sample of 117 adults (Experiment 1) and 57 children aged 8 to 10 years (Experiment 2), we investigated the respective roles of verbal comprehension, working memory span, and relational reasoning in self-derivation of new knowledge through memory integration. The findings revealed patterns of consistency and inconsistency in the cognitive profiles underlying this form of learning in adults and children. In both adults and children, verbal knowledge and skills accounted for variability in self-derivation. Variance in adults, but not in children, was further explained by working memory. Given that individual differences in self-derivation have implications for real-world academic outcome, we also investigated the association between self-derivation and academic performance. We found that performance on the experimentally based self-derivation paradigm was related to concurrent and longitudinal academic success in both samples. The present research thus builds on the growing body of behavioral and neuroscientific research to advance our understanding of the cognitive factors associated with behaviors that depend on memory integration in both childhood and adulthood and also provides suggestive evidence of critical ways in which the process may differ in children and adults.

This paper studies classiﬁcation of stimuli and category representations in school-aged children and adults when learning to categorize compound, multi-dimensional stimuli. Stimuli were such that both similarity-based and rule-based representations would lead to correct classiﬁcation. This allows testing whether children have a bias for formation of similarity-based representations. The results are at odds with this expectation. Children use both uni-dimensional and multi-dimensional classiﬁcation, and the use of both strategies increases with age. Multi-dimensional classiﬁcation is best characterized as resulting from an analytic strategy rather than from procedural processing of overall-similarity. The conclusion is that children are capable of using complex rule-based categorization strategies that involve the use of multiple features of the stimuli. The main developmental change concerns the efﬁciency and consistency of the explicit learning system.","2012","2022-03-23 12:14:53","2022-03-23 12:14:53","2022-03-23 12:14:53","","","","3","","Front.

The focus of research on the shape bias has been to examine the types of information that learners attend to in one moment in time. The current work takes a different approach by examining whether learners’ categorical biases are related to their retention of information across time. In three experiments, children’s (N = 72) and adults’ (N = 240) memory performance for features of objects was examined in relation to their categorical biases. The results of these experiments demonstrated that the number of shape matches chosen during the shape bias task signiﬁcantly predicted shape memory. Moreover, children and adults with a shape bias were more likely to remember the shape of objects than the color and size of objects.

The ability to selectively attend to and encode relevant stimuli is a particularly useful form of mnemonic control, and is one that undergoes marked improvement over childhood. We hypothesized that structural integrity of white matter tracts, in particular those connecting medial temporal lobe memory regions to other cortical areas, and/or those connecting frontal and parietal control regions, should contribute to successful mnemonic control. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between structural integrity of selected white matter tracts and an experimental measure of mnemonic control, involving enhancement of memory by attention at encoding, in 116 children aged 7–11 and 25 young adults. We observed a positive relationship between integrity of uncinate fasciculus and mnemonic enhancement across age groups. In adults, but not in children, we also observed an association between mnemonic enhancement and integrity of ventral cingulum bundle and ventral fornix/ﬁmbria.

After 4- to 9-year-olds and their parents reminisced about past shared events, the children (with an experimenter) produced narratives based on wordless picture books. The results revealed that the overall quality of the ﬁctional narratives was correlated with parents’ provision statements that emphasized orientation and evaluation in the reminiscence narrative. For younger children, correlations held for reminiscence narratives about recent events. For older children, correlations held for reminiscence narratives about events from the distant past.

For false recognition, when information was encoded on a shallow level, we found a different pattern for young children compared with that for older children and adults. False recognition rates were related to the overall amount of correctly remembered information for 7-year-olds, whereas no such association was found for the other age groups. In the second experiment, divided attention decreased true recognition for all ages. In contrast, children’s (7- and 11-year-olds) false recognition rates were again dependent on the overall amount of correctly remembered information, whereas adults’ false recognition was left unaffected.

Across three experiments, learning, memory, and the validity of two transitive paradigms were investigated. In Experiment 1 (N = 121), 7-year-olds completed a three-term nontraining task or a five-term task requiring extensive-training. Performance was superior on the three-term task. Experiment 2 presented 5–10-year-olds with a new five-term task, increasing learning opportunities without lengthening training (N = 71). Inferences improved, suggesting children can learn five-term series rapidly. Regarding memory, the minor (CD) premise was the best predictor of BD-inferential performance in both task-types. However, tasks exhibited different profiles according to associations between the major (BC) premise and BD inference, correlations between the premises, and the role of age. Experiment 3 (N = 227) helped rule out the possible objection that the above findings simply stemmed from three-term tasks with real objects being easier to solve than computer-tasks. It also confirmed that, unlike for five-term task (Experiments 1 & 2), inferences on three-term tasks improve with age, whether the age range is wide (Experiment 3) or narrow (Experiment 2). I conclude that the tasks indexed different routes within a dualprocess conception of transitive reasoning: The five-term tasks indexes Type 1 (associative) processing, and the three-term task indexes Type 2 (analytic) processing. As well as demonstrating that both tasks are perfectly valid, these findings open up opportunities to use transitive tasks for educability, to investigate the role of transitivity in other domains of reasoning, and potentially to benefit the lived experiences of persons with developmental issues.","2021-06","2022-03-23 12:15:47","2022-03-23 12:15:47","2022-03-23 12:15:47","204-221","","2","49","","Learn Behav","Towards a resolution of some outstanding issues in transitive research","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\7XAPJDRG\Wright - 2021 - Towards a resolution of some outstanding issues in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the relationship between hippocampal volume and SES in a group of children (n = 31, age 8–12 years) and a group of young adults (n = 32, age 18–25 years). SES was assessed with four indicators that loaded on a single factor, therefore a composite SES scores was used in the main analyses. Hippocampal volume was measured using manual demarcation on high resolution structural images. SES was associated with hippocampal volume in the children, but not in adults, suggesting that in childhood, but not adulthood, SES-­related environmental factors influence hippocampal volume. In addition, hippocampal volume, but not SES, was associated with scores on a memory task, suggesting that net effects of postnatal environmental factors, captured by SES, are more distal determinants of memory performance than hippocampal volume. Longitudinal investigation of the association between SES, hippocampal volume and cognitive functioning may further our understanding of the putative neural mechanisms underlying SES-­related environmental effects on cognitive development.","2018-05","2022-03-23 12:15:52","2022-03-23 12:15:52","2022-03-23 12:15:52","e12561","","3","21","","Dev Sci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\PV5G8TWI\Yu et al. - 2018 - Socioeconomic status and hippocampal volume in chi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spontaneous use of elaborative strategies, which can enhance the recall of information, expands with age and contributes to age-associated improvement in memory functioning. Findings from lesion and neuroimaging studies suggest that the ability to use elaborative strategies is dependent upon intact functioning of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly the dorsolateral PFC region. Because the PFC undergoes protracted maturation, we examined whether age difference in the structure of the PFC is correlated with age-associated increase in strategy use. Here, we investigated the relationship between PFC volume and spontaneous strategy use in a sample of 120 participants aged 5–25 years. We assessed semantic clustering during recall with a standardized word-list recall task (California Verbal Learning Task children's version, CVLT-C) and computed PFC regional volumes from participants' structural brain images. We observed an age-associated increase in the use of semantic clustering and an age-associated decrease in volumes of the PFC. Further, we found that smaller PFC volume was linked to increased use of semantic clustering. Importantly, the volume of the right dorsolateral PFC partially explained the relation between age and the use of semantic clustering. These ﬁndings suggest that PFC maturation supports the development of strategy use and lends further support for the notion that brain-behavior relations change across development.","2018-11","2022-03-23 12:15:56","2022-03-23 12:15:56","2022-03-23 12:15:56","162-169","","","181","","NeuroImage","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\M4NT48B2\Yu et al. - 2018 - Age-associated increase in mnemonic strategy use i.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In juvenile but not adult song birds learning a tutor’s song, a stronger initial deterioration of song performance over night-sleep predicts better song performance in the long run. This and similar observations have stimulated the view of sleep supporting skill formation during development in an unsupervised off-line learning process that, in the absence of external feedback, can initially also enhance inaccuracies in skill performance. Here we explored whether in children learning a motor sequence task, as in song-learning juvenile birds, changes across sleep after initial practice predict performance levels achieved in the long run. The task was a serial reaction time task (SRTT) where subjects had to press buttons which were lighted up in a repeating eight-element sequence as fast as possible. Twenty-five children (8–12 years) practised the task in the evening before nocturnal sleep which was recorded polysomnographically. Retrieval was tested on the following morning and again 1 week later after daily training on the SRTT. As expected, changes in response speed over the initial night of sleep were negatively correlated with final performance speed after the 1-week training. However, unlike in song birds, this correlation was driven by the baseline speed level achieved before sleep. Baseline-corrected changes in speed or variability over the initial sleep period did not predict final performance on the trained SRTT sequence, or on different sequences introduced to assess generalization of the trained behaviour. The lack of correlation between initial sleep-dependent changes and long-term performance might reflect that the children were too experienced for the simple SRTT, possibly also favouring ceiling effects in performance. A consistent association found between sleep spindle activity and explicit sequence knowledge alternatively suggests that the expected correlation was masked by explicit memory systems interacting with skill memory formation.","2017-11","2022-03-23 12:16:04","2022-03-23 12:16:04","2022-03-23 12:16:04","e12463","","6","20","","Dev Sci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\S7CMCEEH\Zinke et al. - 2017 - Children's initial sleep-associated changes in mot.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A major outcome of Chi's research was that although adult novices had a better memory span than child experts, the children showed better memory for chess positions than the adults. The major goal of this study was to explore the effects of the following task characteristics on memory performance: (1) Familiarity with the constellation of chess pieces (i.e., meaningful versus random positions) and (2) familiarity with both the geometrical structure of the board and the form and color of chess pieces. The tasks presented to the four groups of subjects (i.e., child experts and novices, adult experts and novices) included memory for meaningful and random chess positions as well as memory for the location of wooden pieces of different forms on a board geometrically structured by circles, triangles, rhombuses, etc. (control task 1). Further, a digit span memory task was given (control task 2). The major assumption was that the superiority of experts should be greatest for the meaningful chess positions, somewhat reduced but still significant for the random positions, and nonsignificant for the board control task. Only age effects were expected for the digit span task. The results conformed to this pattern, showing that each type of knowledge contributed to the experts' superior memory span for chess positions.","1993-12","2022-03-23 12:52:20","2022-03-23 12:52:20","","328-349","","3","56","","J Exp Child Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 8301242","","; C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\XLC53NDX\Schneider et al. - 1993 - Chess expertise and memory for chess positions in .pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8301242","","Adolescent; Age Factors; Child; Humans; Memory; Adult; Cognition; Female; Male; Mental Recall; Play and Playthings; Task Performance and Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the preschoolers succeeded only with those arrays in which drawings in the same orientation were juxtaposed. Memory for the most complicated array was not accurate enough until age 9. During the study, the oldest children usually verbalized the orientations as a sequence or the positions of the drawings in each orientation distinctively, whereas most of the younger children simply expressed the orientations discretely. This was interpreted as indicating that only the oldest children executed the sophisticated encoding strategies that integrate information on the orientation and position.

Working from a model of early childhood memory development proposed by Nelson and Ross (1980), I hypothesized that children would show early childhood amnesia and that this could be tested by comparing obtained estimates of memory strength to values predicted by a standard retention function. The data confirm this hypothesis for 6- and 10-year-old children and suggest that the early childhood amnesia period extends from birth to a point between the third and fourth birthdays. The data also support a prediction, derived from the aforementioned model, that children would report a disproportionate number of general memories from the amnesia period. Thus, the developmental model provides a useful vehicle for examining early childhood amnesia and helps to frame further questions such as why some specific memories from this period are retained even though most are lost.","1991-06-01","2022-03-23 13:44:40","2022-03-23 13:44:40","2022-03-23 13:44:40","159-171","","2","152","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/00221325.1991.9914663 PMID: 1895069","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\9ECVBDMZ\00221325.1991.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preschoolers′ narratives about personally experienced events were assessed longitudinally at 40, 46, 58, and 70 months of age. Surprisingly, even at the earliest age studied, children were able to recount reasonably long and coherent narrative. But their narratives become more complex, more coherent, and more detailed over time. Additional analyses on the same events recalled repeatedly indicated that recall was stable over long delays. In fact, there was some evidence that children′s narratives about the same event became more elaborate and more complex over time, particularly between the ages of 4 and 5 years.

With regard to (1), only the older Ss in this study tended to show a specific, fairly complex memorization strategy when given unlimited time to study a set of items to the point of perfect serial recall. The strategy appeared to consist of first naming the items to oneself to initiate the learning process, and of subsequently using systematic anticipation and rehearsal procedures to monitor and maintain one's gradually increasing state of recall readiness. As for (2), the older Ss were likewise better able than the younger ones, both to predict their own memory span in advance of any concrete memorization experience, and to assess their readiness to recall after such experience. It was concluded that the two phenomena are intimately interrelated in the older child's memorization activities, and that the nature and development of S's knowledge and awareness of his own memory system is a particularly important and timely research problem.","1970-10-01","2022-03-23 13:48:01","2022-03-23 13:48:01","2022-03-23 13:48:01","324-340","","4","1","","Cognitive Psychology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\YB756S3H\0010028570900198.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in both experiments 1 and 2, 6-year-olds were not as good at discriminating what they had said earlier from what they had only thought. The possibility that younger children simply have more difficulty distinguishing between memories originating from the same class, internal or external, was ruled out because 6-year-olds performed as well as 9-year-olds when differentiating between memories from 2 external sources (experiment 2). Nor could their difficulty be attributed to a general problem in distinguishing memories for their thoughts from any other class of memories because they were at no disadvantage in discriminating their earlier thoughts (words they imagined themselves saying) from words someone else said (experiment 2).

We examined how developmental differences in perceptual and conceptual priming, two types of implicit memory, coincide with differences between familiarity and recollective responses on explicit memory tests that employ the Remember/Know paradigm ( Tulving, 1985 ). Both types of priming were characterized by developmental invariance in 52 children and adolescents ages 8-19 years. Contrary to Komatsu, Naito, and Fuke (1996) results, few age-group differences in perceptual priming were observed following a levels-of-processing encoding manipulation. In contrast, age group differences were found for ""Remember"" but not ""Know"" responses. Neither levels of awareness nor strategies influenced priming. Adult levels of performance appear earlier in development on perceptual and conceptual priming tests compared to explicit memory tests. Similar developmental dissociations exist between explicit and implicit memory performance as between ""Remember"" and ""Know"" recollective responses.","2002-07","2022-03-23 15:13:05","2022-03-23 15:13:05","","251-277","","3","82","","J Exp Child Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 12093109","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12093109","","Adolescent; Age Factors; Child; Child Development; Humans; Memory; Adult; Female; Male; Mental Recall; Awareness; Cues; Knowledge; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Perception; Recognition, Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All children received categorized items of moderate typicality for Phases 1, 3, and 4. For Phase 2, children were assigned to either a training or control group, with half of the children in each group receiving category typical items and the others category atypical items. Levels of recall, sorting, and clustering were greater in Phase 2 for high-IQ children, for the typical lists, and for trained children. Both the high- and low-IQ children trained with typical items continued to show high levels of recall on the near extension phase. No group of subjects maintained high levels of recall after 1 week, although levels of sorting and/or clustering on the extension trials remained high for all groups of subjects except the low-IQ control children. This latter pattern (elevated sorting/clustering with low levels of recall) is an indication of a utilization deficiency, a phase in strategy development when children use a strategy but gain little or no benefit in performance. The results provide evidence for IQ, training, and material effects in the demonstration of a utilization deficiency.","1994","2022-03-23 15:15:45","2022-03-23 15:15:45","2022-03-23 15:15:45","951-965","","3","65","","","Training and Extension of a Memory Strategy","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1994.tb00795.x","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\EFF4CBW8\Bjorklund et al. - 1994 - Training and Extension of a Memory Strategy Evide.pdf; C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\Q4M28RK6\j.1467-8624.1994.tb00795.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This coherence allows for the reconstruction of different aspects of an experience when triggered by a cue related to a past event—a process of pattern completion. Previous work has shown that such holistic recollection is evident in young adults, as revealed by dependency in retrieval success for various associations from the same event. In addition, episodic memory shows clear quantitative increases during early childhood. However, the ontogeny of holistic recollection is uncharted. Using dependency analyses, we found here that 4-year-olds ( n = 32), 6-year-olds ( n = 30), and young adults ( n = 31) all retrieved complex events in a holistic manner; specifically, retrieval accuracy for one aspect of an event predicted accuracy for other aspects of the same event. However, the degree of holistic retrieval increased from the age 4 to adulthood. Thus, extended refinement of multiway binding may be one aspect of episodic memory development.","2019-12","2022-03-23 15:44:30","2022-03-23 15:44:30","2022-03-23 15:44:30","1696-1706","","12","30","","Psychol Sci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\GPMI88PM\Ngo et al. - 2019 - Development of Holistic Episodic Recollection.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sequential, spatial, and causal relations among the activities remained constant across episodes.

This study examined whether children with high-functioning autism have this same dissociation between explicit and implicit memory abilities. Children with autism and normal development participated in three memory tasks: one implicit task (perceptual identification) and two explicit tasks (recognition and recall). Children with autism showed intact implicit and explicit memory abilities. However, they did not show the typical pattern of recalling more items from both the beginning and end of a list and instead only recalled items from the end of the list. These results do not support the theory that high-functioning autism is a type of medial temporal lobe amnesia.

To investigate this, experiments were conducted with 30 4- and 30 5-yr.-olds. Experiments first examined whether the children could report parent-child games in a sports festival two days after the festival. The results indicated that 4-yr.-olds could not report the episodic contents of the games properly even though they reported the results of the ball matches as well as the 5-yr.-olds. Seven days after that report, the subject was told twice by the experimenter about realistic or unrealistic events as if these were their own experiences. The subject was again required to report the events seven days after receiving information. The results showed that 4-yr.-olds tended to mistake the information provided by the experimenter for their own real experiences.

In the first experiment reported here, 4- and 7-year-olds were presented with paired-associate learning tasks requiring memory structures of different complexity. A multinomial-processing tree model was applied to estimate the use of different structures in the two age groups. The use of two-way list-context-to-target structures and three-way structures was found to increase between the ages of 4 and 7.

In the first experiment, 3- and 4-year-olds were asked to recall pictures of familiar items contained within an array of boxes. The 4-year-olds recalled more pictures when the array of boxes was left in front of them than when it was removed, but the 3-year-olds' recall was not facilitated by the presence of the spatial context. The second experiment examined whether spatial context would aid recall of the objects within it even for the youngest children when a more naturalistic and meaningful task was used. Preschool children played in a small room containing a variety of objects that they encountered during the course of pretend play with an experimenter. They left the room and returned to find it empty. The experimenter asked children to recall the missing objects while they were either inside the room (i. e., in the presence of the spatial context), or outside of the room. The objects were then ""found"" and the child was asked to replace them in the room. Recall of an object's location was found to be related to recall of the object itself. Results indicated that at least in meaningful situations, the ability to use the spatial context of items to facilitate item recall is present from a very early age. Ways in which later developments in abilities to mentally represent spatial layouts might contribute to more sophisticated, strategic uses of spatial context as a mnemonic aid were also discussed.","1984","2022-03-23 16:19:12","2022-03-23 16:19:12","2022-03-23 16:19:12","1835-1844","","5","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [Wiley, Society for Research in Child Development]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The perceptual similarity among members of basic categories suggests that a child could learn these categories simply from exposure to exemplars. The dissimilarity among members of superordinate categories suggests a child would also need to be informed of the relevant criteria for categorization. Developmental differences were predicted in the ability to benefit from the linguistically specified criterial information. These hypotheses were tested by having preschool, kindergarten, and first-grade children learn artificial animal categories. Each child was trained on 1 category through exemplar information alone and 1 through exemplar information supplemented with linguistic descriptions of criterial properties. The results supported the hypotheses: Linguistic information facilitated acquisition of only superordinate, not basic level, categories, and only for the older children. These findings indicate that the internal structure of categories and the processing abilities of the learner are important determinants of acquisition.","1980","2022-03-23 16:19:49","2022-03-23 16:19:49","2022-03-23 16:19:49","708-719","","3","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [Wiley, Society for Research in Child Development]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Children studied either a single DRM list (control) or two DRM lists in succession with a directed-remembering instruction or a directed-forgetting instruction between list presentations. The findings indicated that, like adults, children effectively suppressed the output of true memories when given a directed-forgetting instruction. Unlike adults, whose false memories are not attenuated in directed-forgetting conditions, children suppressed false memories at recall in the directed-forgetting condition. Because recognition data indicated that the children did generate false memories regardless of instruction, it appears that although adults' false memories are generated automatically and do not become part of their conscious experience, children's false memories are produced with greater effort and conscious processing, and as a result are easier to suppress at output.","2005-12-01","2022-03-23 16:20:42","2022-03-23 16:20:42","2022-03-23 16:20:42","927-931","","12","16","","Psychol Sci","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At each age, half of the children experienced the events once prior to recalling the events both verbally and behaviorally; the other half experienced the events 4 times, recalled the events verbally after each experience, and behaviorally reenacted the events only after the last experience. Children verbally recalled more and organized their recall better for the logical events than for the arbitrary event, and these differences remained stable with increasing experience. The sequencing of behavioral recall was also more accurate for the logical events than for the arbitrary event across age and condition, but amount of recall did not differ, with one exception. 3-year-old children in the single experience condition recalled less about the variable event than the invariant events.

Seven-, 8- and 9-year-olds, and adults (N = 72) enacted, imagined and confabulated about bizarre and common actions. Two weeks later, participants were asked to recognize the actions that had been enacted.

However, only older children and adults exhibited the ability to monitor expected memorability (e.g. reported higher confidence for the rejection of bizarre versus common distracters).

We tested the hypothesis that age-related differences in hippocampal activation may reflect changes in retrieval flexibility. We expected these activation differences to be observed most prominently in the anterior hippocampus. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from children ages 8 and 10, and adults (N = 63) during an associative recognition task that required participants to recognize pairs of pictures which either appeared in the same location as during encoding (Same location), or in a flipped location, such that each picture switched their location with the other member of the pair (Flipped location). Recognition of same-location pairs placed lower demands on flexible retrieval compared to recognition of flipped-location pairs. Behaviorally, 8-year-olds exhibited the strongest correct recognition gains for same-location compared to flipped-location pairs, and females unexpectedly outperformed males across all ages. When we examined correct recognition, adults recruited the hippocampal head more strongly for flipped- versus same-location pairs compared to both groups of children; in contrast both adults and 10-year-olds recruited the hippocampal tail more strongly for flipped- versus same-location pairs compared to 8-year-olds. This pattern was stronger in the left hippocampus and for females. Moreover hippocampal discrimination between recognized and forgotten items in the same-location condition was stronger in 8-year-olds compared to adults, and was stronger in the flipped-location condition in adults compared to 8-year-olds; this pattern was stronger in the left hippocampus. Individual differences in this discrimination contrast for flipped-location trials in the head and body predicted performance on an index of creative thinking. Overall, these results lend new support to the idea that hippocampal development may reflect change in retrieval flexibility with implications for additional forms of flexible cognition. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2016","2022-06-02 13:15:45","2022-06-02 13:15:45","2022-06-02 13:15:45","492-501","","4","26","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.22538","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\LWJJN2IH\DeMaster et al. - 2016 - Retrieval flexibility and reinstatement in the dev.pdf; C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\2PGCZHRX\hipo.html","","","episodic memory; children; flexibility; hippocampal development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessments were repeated twice, with adjacent measurement points separated by 6-month time intervals. One major goal of the initial phase of the study concerned the exploration of the utilization deficiency phenomenon, which refers to the fact that young children who spontaneously use a memory strategy for the first time do not experience immediate memory benefits. Results obtained for the sort–recall task showed that, among those children who acquired a sorting strategy between Times 1 and 2, only a small proportion experienced the utilization deficiency problem. Additional analyses demonstrated that these few children also performed more poorly on the short-term memory tasks and the text recall measure when compared with the groups of efficient strategy users, suggesting that utilization deficiency is accompanied by a more general memory capacity problem. Overall, the findings revealed enormous variability in the early acquisition of memory strategies, indicating that the utilization deficiency phenomenon might not be as frequent as is assumed in the relevant literature.","2004-06-01","2022-06-02 13:24:42","2022-06-02 13:24:42","2022-06-02 13:24:42","193-209","","2","88","","Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","The development of young children’s memory strategies","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\6LDC6PTT\S0022096504000293.html","","","Longitudinal study; Memory development; Multiple strategy use; Utilization deficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a second run, these already familiar pictures were repeated as non-targets along with new pictures, while subjects were instructed to indicate only recurrences within the run. Young adults were able to maintain high performance levels in both tasks, whereas children had longer response times and committed a large number of false alarms to non-targets. ERPs in both age groups showed similar parietal old/new effects for target repetitions within runs. In addition, adults’ ERPs showed similar old/new effects at frontal electrodes for repetitions and non-targets, presumably reflecting assessments of familiarity, whereas for children repeated relative to first presentations were associated with more negative-going waveforms at anterior frontal recording sites. Together, these results suggest a continuing maturation of the brain networks assessing novelty or familiarity.

Second, the authors investigated whether short-term or working memory capacity at time point 1 predicted recall in children who did or did not use the semantic grouping strategy 1.5 years later. Third, the authors investigated whether prompted strategic children and children who used the strategy spontaneously differed in strategy transfer to a new task. Developmental results confirmed previous cross-sectional results, but in a longitudinal two-cohort study 6–7-year-olds were nonstrategic, and became prompted strategic around 8–9 years of age, followed by spontaneous strategy use at age 10–11 years. The authors found that memory capacity was not predictive of later use of the strategy.

In Experiment 1, we show that dissociation of the two types of memory can be demonstrated with pictures as stimuli and with naming latency and recognition scores as responses. The depth-of-processing manipulation affects recognition but not naming, whereas both are influenced by prior exposure. Experiment 2 is a replication of the naming procedure, with a smaller set of stimuli and instructions emphasizing speed. Experiments 3 and 4 extend the paradigm to include children from 5 to 10 years old. Experiment 3 demonstrates the usual effect of depth of processing on recognition, but, in contrast to the adult data of Experiment 1, there is an analogous effect upon subsequent naming latencies. Examination of the data suggests this may be a spurious result. If not, it means either that the two memory types are not independent in children or that the “deep” subjects were implicitly naming during encoding. In Experiment 4, we test perceptual memory directly, replacing naming latency with tachistoscopic recognition. This results only in an effect of prior exposure, and not depth of processing. The results support the idea that perceptual memory is distinguishable from recognition memory, and that it is developmentally stable.","1985-05-01","2022-06-02 16:30:26","2022-06-02 16:30:26","2022-06-02 16:30:26","273-279","","3","13","","Memory & Cognition","Autobiographical memory and perceptual learning","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\5UQ8QHFY\Carroll et al. - 1985 - Autobiographical memory and perceptual learning A.pdf","","","Autobiographical Memory; Naming Task; Perceptual Learning; Recognition Memory; Recognition Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiment 1 revealed that between 5 and 9 years, two forms of categorical flexibility can be distinguished: response and conceptual flexibility. It appeared that children's multiple sorts do not necessarily reflect the use of different conceptual organizations. Such a lag was mainly due to a difficulty in accessing taxonomic representations, specifically in the younger age groups. Therefore, Experiment 2 investigated the development of taxonomic representations using an original approach requiring participants to decide whether new items could be included into an existing taxonomic sort. This approach showed that taxonomic representations were only gradually differentiated from thematic and perceptual ones over the 5 to 10 years period. The discussion raises new hypotheses about the interaction between developing executive control (specifically, increasing resistance to interference of irrelevant information) and increasing conceptual knowledge in accounting for the development of conceptual flexibility.","2006-06-01","2022-06-02 16:32:47","2022-06-02 16:32:47","2022-06-02 16:32:47","163-188","","2","3","","","Categorical flexibility in children","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/17405620500412267","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\RAI383GL\17405620500412267.html; C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\QE8X66E4\Blaye et al. - 2006 - Categorical flexibility in children Distinguishin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Familiarity appears to mature relatively early in development and is maintained with aging, whereas recollection shows protracted development and deteriorates with aging. To assess this model, ERP and behavioral data were recorded in children (9–10 years), adolescents (13–14), young (20–30) and older (65–85) adults during a recognition memory task in which the same items were studied and tested over four cycles. Participants decided whether each item was old or new and then whether the decision was associated with (Remember, R) or without (Know, K) contextual detail. Memory sensitivity was greatest in young adults, although all groups showed increases in memory sensitivity and R judgments with repetition. Familiarity-based processes (mid-frontal episodic memory, EM, effect) appeared to be used by adolescents, young and older adults, but apparently not to the same extent by children. Recollection-based processes (parietal EM effect) were recruited by children, adolescents and young adults, but to a much lesser extent by older adults. Repetition enhanced the parietal effect in all but older adults. However, post-hoc analyses indicated that reduced recollective processing was confined to poor-performing older adults. By contrast, children appeared to rely mainly on recollection concordant with their conservative decision criteria across tests. We conclude that episodic-memory development reflects the increasingly flexible and interchangeable use of familiarity and recollection with a breakdown in the latter at older ages, perhaps limited to poor-performing older adults.","2010-01-15","2022-06-02 16:33:48","2022-06-02 16:33:48","2022-06-02 16:33:48","124-141","","","1310","","Brain Research","Changes in familiarity and recollection across the lifespan","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\JDNF3H7S\Friedman et al. - 2010 - Changes in familiarity and recollection across the.pdf; C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\UEWYT39U\S0006899309024421.html","","","Cognitive aging; Cognitive development; ERP episodic memory effect; Familiarity; Lifespan; Recollection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As time is an abstract concept (we cannot see it), some investigators have begun to use ‘time-lines’ or pictorial representations of time to aid children. Yet, there is no published research testing whether children are able to use time-lines and whether they can provide adequate temporal information using them. We tested whether children could indicate the time-of-day of events using a pictorial time-line and then compared their responses to their parents’. Seven- to 8-year-olds were most consistent with parental estimates while 4-year-olds were least consistent. Responses from the 5- to 6-year-olds depended on the temporal task. Guessing and using general knowledge to estimate the time-of-day were ruled out, and so children were genuinely drawing on episodic memory when making time-line judgments.

Episodic memory, on the other hand, preserves the specificity of individual events by binding together unique combinations of elements from an episode and relies on pattern separation to distinguish similar experiences. These two memory systems play complementary roles, supporting different mnemonic goals, but the nature and extent of their interdependence is unclear.1,2 Some models suggest that new information is encoded initially as hippocampus-dependent episodic memory and then, either through repetition or gist extraction, becomes semantic over time.3,4 These models also posit a neocortical route to semantic memory acquisition exists that can bypass the hippocampus.3 Both proposed routes are slow learning mechanisms, yet generalization can occur rapidly. Recent models suggest that fast generalization relies, in part, on the retrieval of individual but related episodes.5,6 Such episodic memory gating mechanisms render fast generalization contingent on the memory specificity of instances, a pattern that has been observed in adults.7,8 None of these models take into account the observation that generalization and episodic specificity have asynchronous developmental profiles, with generalization emerging years before episodic memory.9,10 We ask two questions about generalized and specific memory during early childhood: first, is rapid generalization contingent on remembering specific past memories? And second, does the strength or nature of this contingency differ across development? We found that the interdependence of generalization and episodic memory varies across development: generalization success in adults, but not in children, was contingent on context binding.","2021-06-21","2022-06-02 16:39:14","2022-06-02 16:39:14","2022-06-02 16:39:14","2690-2697.e5","","12","31","","Current Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\GWJUUALT\S0960982221004619.html","","","episodic memory; memory development; memory generalization; memory specificity; semantic knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While much is understood about the role of hippocampal function in learning and memory in adults, less is known about the relations between the hippocampus and the development of these cognitive skills in young children due to the limitations of using standard methods (e.g., MRI) to examine brain structure and function in developing populations. This study used hippocampal-dependent trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) as a feasible approach to examine individual differences in hippocampal functioning as they relate to spatial reorientation and episodic memory performance in young children. Three- to six-year-old children (N = 50) completed tasks that measured EBC, spatial reorientation, and episodic memory, as well as non-hippocampal-dependent processing speed abilities. Results revealed that when age was held constant, individual differences in EBC performance were significantly related to individual differences in performance on the spatial reorientation test, but not on the episodic memory or processing speed tests. When the relations between hippocampal-dependent EBC and different reorientation strategies were explored, it was found that individual differences in hippocampal function predicted the use of geometric information for reorienting in space as opposed to a combined strategy that uses both geometric information and salient visual cues. The utilization of eyeblink conditioning to examine hippocampal function in young populations and its implications for understanding the dissociation between spatial reorientation and episodic memory development are discussed.","2020","2022-06-02 16:51:29","2022-06-02 16:51:29","2022-06-02 16:51:29","e12867","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/desc.12867","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\D24L6TED\Vieites et al. - 2020 - Using hippocampal-dependent eyeblink conditioning .pdf; C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\4KJDYDU5\desc.html","","","hippocampus; individual differences; spatial reorientation; trace eyeblink conditioning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current study, we asked how children’s episodic memory is affected by stimulus overlap, delay, and age using visual stimuli containing either overlapping or unique item pairs. Children aged 4 and 6 years were tested both immediately and after a 24-h delay. As expected, older children performed better than younger children, and both age groups performed worse on overlapping pairs. Surprisingly, the 24-h delay had only a marginal effect on overall accuracy.

If such theories hold true, then does the development of EM in children depend on the ability to first bind spatial and temporal information? And does this ability rely, at least in part, on normal hippocampal function? We investigated the development of EM in children 2–8 years of age (Study 1) and its impairment in Williams Syndrome, a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by visuospatial deficits and irregular hippocampal function, (Study 2) by implementing a nonverbal object-placement task that dissociates the               what               ,               where               , and               when               components of EM.

Four-year-old children discussed personal past experiences with their mothers and with a researcher. In collaborative recall with their mothers, children's narrative behavior was regulated best by maternal use of specific elaborative components, such as affirmations. In contrast, in children's independent recall, affective and behavioral qualities of maternal support were related to children's memory performance. Specifically, during free-recall, the dimensions of quality of instruction and respect for autonomy were significant predictors of children's narratives. In the context of prompted recall (supported by wh-questions), respect for autonomy was the only significant predictor of children's involvement in the conversations and of the amount of unique content they provided.

The present study focused on developmental trends of different types of spontaneous false memories. Specifically, in the current study, 6–8 year-olds, 10–12 year-olds, and adults were presented with two methods to induce spontaneous false memories: (i) semantically related word lists that are commonly used to evoke spontaneous false memories [i.e, Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm]; and (ii) a video in which related details were not shown but were presented during a recognition task. The results showed that children were more likely to form false memories than adults in the video false memory paradigm, whereas DRM false memories were more evident in adults than in children. Furthermore, we found that on a general level, DRM false memories were positively related to video spontaneous false memories. We explain that stimuli that contain obvious themes attenuate or even reverse developmental trends in spontaneous false memories.

Using these contrasting protocols, 3-and 5-year-old children were asked to remember the details of a routine physical examination. Neither doll protocol facilitated 3-year-olds' recall of the features of the check-up. In contrast, 5-year-olds who were asked to demonstrate with a doll what happened in their examination showed enhanced recall. The inclusion of a doll had no effect on older or younger children's provision of elaborative detail about their visits to the doctor.

Episodic memory, in its technical meaning given by Tulving, requires the autonoetic consciousness of having experienced remembered events, but developmental findings suggest that children cannot encode events as experienced before the age of about 4 or 5 years. Before this age they have insufficient understanding of what constitutes experience, specifically they do not reflect on the perceptual origin of their own knowledge. To demonstrate such a link children between 3 and 6 years were assessed for their understanding of the perceptual origin of their own knowledge on different ""see-know tests,"" in particular a test assessing understanding that our senses inform only about certain aspects of the perceived objects. A significant association was found between passing see-know tests and free recall, which persisted even when cued recall and verbal intelligence are partialed out. These results are used to argue that between 3 to 6 years children develop the ability to remember events as experienced and that this development can explain adults′ inability to have recollective experiences of childhood events before that age (childhood amnesia).","1995-06-01","2022-06-02 17:22:32","2022-06-02 17:22:32","2022-06-02 17:22:32","516-548","","3","59","","Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","Episodic Memory and Autonoetic Conciousness","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\WY2UCKRD\S0022096585710247.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results showed that more salient visual feedback reduced the learning effort for length but not for weight comparisons. After training children were tested on all possible object pairs. Children's comparisons of items by length were very accurate in contrast to their comparisons by weight. An explanation for these findings is suggested by the data from a group of 6-year-olds who were trained on two independent pairs of a four-term series. Test results showed that subjects spontaneously encoded absolute lengths but tended to ignore information about the absolute weight of objects. It is suggested that high test accuracy depends on stimulus material for which the absolute values of the relevant dimension are encoded.

Indeed, research on SL has grown rapidly over recent decades in an effort to better understand perception and cognition. Yet, there remain gaps in our understanding of how SL operates, in particular with regard to its (im)mutability. Here, we investigated whether participant-related variables (such as age) and task-related variables (such as speed of stimulus presentation) affect visual statistical learning (VSL) in typically developing children. We tested 183 participants ranging in age from 5 to 12 years and compared three speeds of presentation (using stimulus durations of 800, 400 and 200 msecs). A multiple regression analysis revealed significant effects of both age and speed of presentation – after attention during familiarization and gender had been taken into consideration. VSL followed a developmental trajectory whereby learning increased with age. The amount of learning increased with longer presentation times (as shown by Turk-Browne, Jungé & Scholl, 2005, in their study of adults). There was no significant interaction between the two variables. These findings assist in elucidating the nature of statistical learning itself. While statistical learning can be observed in very young children and at remarkably fast presentation times, participant- and task-related variables do impact upon this type of learning. The findings reported here may serve to enhance our understanding of individual differences in the cognitive and perceptual processes that are thought to rely, at least in part, on SL (e.g. language processing and object recognition).","2011","2022-06-02 17:46:25","2022-06-02 17:46:25","2022-06-02 17:46:25","464-473","","3","14","","","Statistical learning in typically developing children","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00937.x","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\85HMPIG2\Arciuli and Simpson - 2011 - Statistical learning in typically developing child.pdf; C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\JJLRLJMK\j.1467-7687.2009.00937.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While much work has examined statistical learning in infants and adults, less work has looked at the developmental trajectory of SL during childhood to see whether it is fully developed in infancy or improves with age, like many other cognitive abilities. A recent study showed modality-based differences in the effect of age during childhood: While visual SL improved with age, auditory SL did not. This finding was taken as evidence for modality-based differences in SL. However, since that study used auditory linguistic stimuli (syllables), the differential effect of age may have been driven by stimulus type (linguistic vs. non-linguistic) rather than modality. Here, we ask whether age will affect performance similarly in the two modalities when non-linguistic auditory stimuli are used (familiar sounds instead of syllables). We conduct a large-scale study of children's performance on visual and non-linguistic auditory SL during childhood (ages 5–12 years). The results show a similar effect of age in both modalities: Unlike previous findings, both visual and non-linguistic auditory SL improved with age. These findings highlight the stimuli-sensitive nature of SL and suggest that modality-based differences may be stimuli-dependent, and that age-invariance may be limited to linguistic stimuli.","2018","2022-06-02 17:47:30","2022-06-02 17:47:30","2022-06-02 17:47:30","3100-3115","","8","42","","","Statistical Learning Is Not Age-Invariant During Childhood","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cogs.12692","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\VK9DYSYW\Shufaniya and Arnon - 2018 - Statistical Learning Is Not Age-Invariant During C.pdf; C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\W7WDL93I\cogs.html","","","Children; Age-invariance; Auditory; Developmental trajectory; Language learning; Statistical learning; Visual","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accuracy and z-transformed data showed partially different developmental curves, suggesting a re-evaluation of analysis methods in developmental research. The decrement in raw RT differences supports an extension of the traditional two-stage lifespan skill acquisition model: in addition to a decline above the age 60 reported in earlier studies, sensitivity to raw probabilities and, therefore, acquiring new skills is significantly more effective until early adolescence than later in life. These results suggest that due to developmental changes in early adolescence, implicit skill learning processes undergo a marked shift in weighting raw probabilities vs. more complex interpretations of events, which, with appropriate timing, prove to be an optimal strategy for human skill learning.","2012","2022-06-02 17:48:23","2022-06-02 17:48:23","2022-06-02 17:48:23","496-505","","4","15","","","The best time to acquire new skills","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01150.x","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\L9V969JI\Janacsek et al. - 2012 - The best time to acquire new skills age-related d.pdf; C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\TRZK9B9R\j.1467-7687.2012.01150.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we examine functional brain development during successful memory retrieval of scenes in children, adolescents, and young adults ages 8–21 via functional magnetic resonance imaging. Recognition memory improved with age, specifically for accurate identification of studied scenes (hits). Successful retrieval (correct old–new decisions for studied vs unstudied scenes) was associated with activations in frontal, parietal, and medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions. Activations associated with successful retrieval increased with age in left parietal cortex (BA7), bilateral prefrontal, and bilateral caudate regions. In contrast, activations associated with successful retrieval did not change with age in the MTL. Psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that there were, however, age-relate changes in differential connectivity for successful retrieval between MTL and prefrontal regions. These results suggest that neocortical regions related to attentional or strategic control show the greatest developmental changes for memory retrieval of scenes. Furthermore, these results suggest that functional interactions between MTL and prefrontal regions during memory retrieval also develop into young adulthood. The developmental increase of memory-related activations in frontal and parietal regions for retrieval of scenes and the absence of such an increase in MTL regions parallels what has been observed for memory encoding of scenes.","2012-07-18","2022-06-02 17:49:23","2022-06-02 17:49:23","2022-06-02 17:49:23","10012-10020","","29","32","","J.

Further, these differences in style are related to children's performance in such conversations. This study examines within-family similarity in maternal style and the relations between maternal style and child gender and temperament. Mothers from 16 families, each with one male and one female child aged 3 and 5 years, participated individually in memory conversations. Results indicated that mothers showed similar use of elaborations across children but used more repetitions and evaluations in conversations with younger children. Contrary to previous research, maternal style was not related to child gender; however, relations were found between child temperament and maternal style. Results are discussed in relation to the social interaction model of autobiographical memory.","1999-07-01","2022-06-02 17:53:45","2022-06-02 17:53:45","2022-06-02 17:53:45","381-399","","3","14","","Cognitive Development","Maternal Style in Reminiscing","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\uyenn\Zotero\storage\CCH7INU4\S0885201499000118.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data gathered from these knowledge-production protocols were used to map 2 interrelated semantic networks of dinosaurs, viewed as concept nodes connected by links. The 2 mappings corresponded to 2 sets of dinosaurs (20 each), partitioned on the basis of external criteria: mother's subjective judgment of the S's knowledge of each dinosaur and the frequency of mention in the S's dinosaur books. Comparisons of the structure of the 2 mappings were based on 3 attributes: (a) number of links, (b) strength of links, and (c) the internal cohesion of the network in terms of higher-order groupings and specific patterns of interlinkages. The validity of the differential structures of the 2 mappings was verified by the corresponding differential memory performance. The better structured set of dinosaurs was more easily remembered and retained by the S over a year than the less structured set of dinosaurs.

Consistent with previous research on intelligence-related differences in controlled and automatic processes, students without mental retardation performed better than those with mental retardation on the explicit memory task, but there was no difference between groups on the implicit memory task. For both groups implicit and explicit memory increased from age 6 to 8 to age 10 to 12, but did not significantly increase to age 15 to 17. Because implicit memory appears to be a relative strength for students with mental retardation, we suggest further exploration into broader types of implicit processes that may be useful in training situations.","1998-03","2022-06-03 13:01:53","2022-06-03 13:01:53","","511-526","","5","102","","Am J Ment Retard","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9544347","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9544347","","Adolescent; Age Factors; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Education of Intellectually Disabled; Form Perception; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Intelligence Tests; Memory; Perceptual Closure; Psychomotor Performance; Severity of Illness Index; Teaching; Visual Perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In pilot testing and large scale application of the test, the COAT was demonstrated to be a reliable and a valid measure of declarative memory for healthy children ages 18-36 months, living in a disadvantaged community. The test shows a linear developmental trajectory, which allows longitudinal examination of the development of declarative memory in children.","2008-01","2022-06-03 13:04:50","2022-06-03 13:04:50","","21-41","","1","14","","Child Neuropsychol","The Color Object Association Test (COAT)","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 18097800","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18097800","","Child, Preschool; Humans; Memory; Cognition; Female; Male; Association; Color Perception; Infant; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Reproducibility of Results","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over 100 children reported personal experiences when they were 4, 6 or 8 years old, enabling a determination of age-related differences in two aspects of narrative coherence: Theme and chronology. Content was assessed separately through the presentation of directed memory probes. After a 1-year delay, younger children more frequently failed to report target experiences. Multilevel modelling indicated that the survivability of a memory was predicted over and above the child's age by high thematic coherence of the initial memory narrative, but not by the memory content. It is possible that memories described in a highly thematically coherent narrative are indicative of well-integrated event memories, and thus likely to be cued more often, resulting in their long-term survival.
